    "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting \
by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had \
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or \
conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", "CreationDate" ->

          "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", "CreationDate" ->

          "1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 1:2 And \
the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the \
deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 1:3 And God \
said, Let there be light: and there was light. 1:4 And God saw the light, \
that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 1:5 And God \
called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and \
the morning were the first day. 1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in \
the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 1:7 \
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the \
firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 1:8 \
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the \
second day. 1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered \
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 1:10 And \
God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters \
called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 1:11 And God said, Let the \
earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding \
fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. \
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his \
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: \
and God saw that it was good. 1:13 And the evening and the morning were the \
third day. 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the \
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for \
seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in the \
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 1:16 And \
God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser \
light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 1:17 And God set them in the \
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over \
the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and \
God saw that it was good. 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the \
fourth day. 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the \
moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the \
open firmament of heaven. 1:21 And God created great whales, and every living \
creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their \
kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the \
waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 1:23 And the evening \
and the morning were the fifth day. 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring \
forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and \
beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 1:25 And God made the beast \
of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing \
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \
1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let \
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, \
and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing \
that creepeth upon the earth. 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in \
the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 1:28 And \
God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and \
replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the \
sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth \
upon the earth. 1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb \
bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the \
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 1:30 \
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every \
thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every \
green herb for meat: and it was so. 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had \
made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the \
sixth day. 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host \
of them. 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and \
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 2:3 And God \
blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested \
from all his work which God created and made. 2:4 These are the generations \
of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the \
LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field \
before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for \
the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a \
man to till the ground. 2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and \
watered the whole face of the ground. 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the \
dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and \
man became a living soul. 2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in \
Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 2:9 And out of the ground \
made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good \
for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of \
knowledge of good and evil. 2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the \
garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 2:11 The \
name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of \
Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there \
is bdellium and the onyx stone. 2:13 And the name of the second river is \
Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 2:14 And \
the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the \
east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 2:15 And the LORD God \
took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. \
2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden \
thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and \
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou \
shalt surely die. 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man \
should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 2:19 And out of the \
ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the \
air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and \
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 2:20 \
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every \
beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. \
2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: \
and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 \
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and \
brought her unto the man. 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, \
and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out \
of Man. 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall \
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 2:25 And they were both \
naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 3:1 Now the serpent was \
more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he \
said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of \
the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit \
of the trees of the garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the \
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye \
touch it, lest ye die. 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not \
surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your \
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 3:6 And \
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant \
to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit \
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did \
eat. 3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were \
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 3:8 \
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of \
the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD \
God amongst the trees of the garden. 3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, \
and said unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the \
garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 3:11 And he \
said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, \
whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, \
The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did \
eat. 3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast \
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 3:14 And \
the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art \
cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly \
shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 3:15 And I \
will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her \
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 3:16 Unto the \
woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in \
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy \
husband, and he shall rule over thee. 3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because \
thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, \
of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the \
ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \
3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt \
eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat \
bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for \
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 3:20 And Adam called his \
wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 3:21 Unto Adam \
also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. \
3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know \
good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree \
of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him \
forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. \
3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden \
Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the \
tree of life. 4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare \
Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 4:2 And she again bare his \
brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the \
ground. 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the \
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4:4 And Abel, he also brought \
of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had \
respect unto Abel and to his offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering \
he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 4:6 \
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance \
fallen? 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest \
not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou \
shalt rule over him. 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came \
to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his \
brother, and slew him. 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy \
brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 4:10 And he said, \
What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the \
ground. 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her \
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou tillest \
the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive \
and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, \
My punishment is greater than I can bear. 4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me \
out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; \
and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to \
pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. 4:15 And the LORD said \
unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him \
sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should \
kill him. 4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in \
the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she \
conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the \
city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: \
and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat \
Lamech. 4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was \
Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the \
father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 4:21 And his \
brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp \
and organ. 4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every \
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 4:23 And \
Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of \
Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a \
young man to my hurt. 4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech \
seventy and sevenfold. 4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, \
and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed \
instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born \
a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of \
the LORD. 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that \
God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female \
created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day \
when they were created. 5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and \
begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name \
Seth: 5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred \
years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived \
were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 5:6 And Seth lived an \
hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat \
Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all \
the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 5:9 And \
Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived after he begat \
Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11 \
And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 5:12 \
And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And Cainan lived \
after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and \
daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: \
and he died. 5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: \
5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty \
years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were \
eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 5:18 And Jared lived an \
hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after \
he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And \
all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. \
5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22 And \
Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and \
begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred \
sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God \
took him. 5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and \
begat Lamech. 5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred \
eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of \
Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 5:28 And \
Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 5:29 And he \
called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work \
and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 5:30 \
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and \
begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred \
seventy and seven years: and he died. 5:32 And Noah was five hundred years \
old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 6:1 And it came to pass, when men \
began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto \
them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; \
and they took them wives of all which they chose. 6:3 And the LORD said, My \
spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his \
days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 6:4 There were giants in the earth \
in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the \
daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men \
which were of old, men of renown. 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man \
was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his \
heart was only evil continually. 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had \
made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 6:7 And the LORD \
said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both \
man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it \
repenteth me that I have made them. 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of \
the LORD. 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and \
perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 6:10 And Noah begat \
three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before \
God, and the earth was filled with violence. 6:12 And God looked upon the \
earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon \
the earth. 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before \
me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will \
destroy them with the earth. 6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms \
shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. \
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the \
ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the \
height of it thirty cubits. 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in \
a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in \
the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. \
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to \
destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and \
every thing that is in the earth shall die. 6:18 But with thee will I \
establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, \
and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 6:19 And of every living thing \
of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them \
alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 6:20 Of fowls after their \
kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth \
after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. \
6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather \
it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 6:22 Thus did \
Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. 7:1 And the LORD \
said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I \
seen righteous before me in this generation. 7:2 Of every clean beast thou \
shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are \
not clean by two, the male and his female. 7:3 Of fowls also of the air by \
sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the \
earth. 7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth \
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will \
I destroy from off the face of the earth. 7:5 And Noah did according unto all \
that the LORD commanded him. 7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the \
flood of waters was upon the earth. 7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and \
his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters \
of the flood. 7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of \
fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two \
and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded \
Noah. 7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood \
were upon the earth. 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the \
second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the \
fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. \
7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 7:13 In the \
selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, \
and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; \
7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their \
kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, \
and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 7:15 And they went \
in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of \
life. 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as \
God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 7:17 And the flood was forty \
days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it \
was lift up above the earth. 7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were \
increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the \
waters. 7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the \
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 7:20 Fifteen \
cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 7:21 \
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, \
and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and \
every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was \
in the dry land, died. 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which \
was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping \
things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: \
and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 7:24 \
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 8:1 And \
God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with \
him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters \
asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were \
stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned \
from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty \
days the waters were abated. 8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on \
the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 8:5 And the \
waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on \
the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 8:6 And it \
came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark \
which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and \
fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8:8 Also he sent \
forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of \
the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she \
returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole \
earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him \
into the ark. 8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent \
forth the dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the \
evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew \
that the waters were abated from off the earth. 8:12 And he stayed yet other \
seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any \
more. 8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the \
first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off \
the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, \
the face of the ground was dry. 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven \
and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 8:15 And God spake unto \
Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and \
thy sons' wives with thee. 8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that \
is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every \
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly \
in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 8:18 And Noah \
went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 8:19 \
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth \
upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 8:20 And Noah \
builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every \
clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 8:21 And the LORD \
smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again \
curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart \
is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing \
living, as I have done. 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, \
and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. \
9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and \
multiply, and replenish the earth. 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of \
you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, \
upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into \
your hand are they delivered. 9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be \
meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 9:4 But \
flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. \
9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every \
beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's \
brother will I require the life of man. 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by \
man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 9:7 And \
you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and \
multiply therein. 9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, \
saying, 9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your \
seed after you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the \
fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that \
go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 9:11 And I will establish my \
covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters \
of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. \
9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me \
and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual \
generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token \
of a covenant between me and the earth. 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when \
I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 \
And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living \
creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy \
all flesh. 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, \
that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living \
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 9:17 And God said unto Noah, \
This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and \
all flesh that is upon the earth. 9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth \
of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. \
9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth \
overspread. 9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a \
vineyard: 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was \
uncovered within his tent. 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the \
nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 9:23 And Shem and \
Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went \
backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were \
backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 9:24 And Noah awoke from \
his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 9:25 And he said, \
Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 9:26 \
And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his \
servant. 9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of \
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 9:28 And Noah lived after the flood \
three hundred and fifty years. 9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine \
hundred and fifty years: and he died. 10:1 Now these are the generations of \
the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after \
the flood. 10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, \
and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and \
Riphath, and Togarmah. 10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, \
Kittim, and Dodanim. 10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in \
their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their \
nations. 10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. \
10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and \
Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 10:8 And Cush begat \
Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 10:9 He was a mighty hunter \
before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter \
before the LORD. 10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, \
and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 10:11 Out of that land went \
forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 \
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 10:13 And \
Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 10:14 And \
Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 10:15 \
And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the Jebusite, and \
the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the \
Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and \
afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 10:19 And the \
border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; \
as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto \
Lasha. 10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their \
tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 10:21 Unto Shem also, the \
father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to \
him were children born. 10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and \
Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and \
Gether, and Mash. 10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 10:25 \
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days \
was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 10:26 And Joktan \
begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, \
and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And \
Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 10:30 And \
their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. \
10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, \
in their lands, after their nations. 10:32 These are the families of the sons \
of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the \
nations divided in the earth after the flood. 11:1 And the whole earth was of \
one language, and of one speech. 11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed \
from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt \
there. 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn \
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. \
11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may \
reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad \
upon the face of the whole earth. 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city \
and the tower, which the children of men builded. 11:6 And the LORD said, \
Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they \
begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have \
imagined to do. 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their \
language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 11:8 So the LORD \
scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they \
left off to build the city. 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; \
because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from \
thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 11:10 \
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat \
Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem lived after he begat \
Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 11:12 And Arphaxad \
lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13 And Arphaxad lived after \
he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. \
11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah lived \
after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and \
daughters. 11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 \
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat \
sons and daughters. 11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 \
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons \
and daughters. 11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: \
11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and \
begat sons and daughters. 11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat \
Nahor: 11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and \
begat sons and daughters. 11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and \
begat Terah: 11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and \
nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 11:26 And Terah lived seventy \
years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 11:27 Now these are the generations \
of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 11:28 And \
Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the \
Chaldees. 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife \
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the \
father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 11:30 But Sarai was barren; she \
had no child. 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran \
his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they \
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; \
and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 11:32 And the days of Terah were \
two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. 12:1 Now the LORD had \
said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from \
thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make \
of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and \
thou shalt be a blessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and \
curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be \
blessed. 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot \
went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out \
of Haran. 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and \
all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had \
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into \
the land of Canaan they came. 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the \
place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the \
land. 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I \
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared \
unto him. 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of \
Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: \
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the \
LORD. 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 12:10 And \
there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn \
there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 12:11 And it came to pass, \
when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, \
Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore \
it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall \
say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. \
12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for \
thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 12:14 And it came to pass, \
that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she \
was very fair. 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her \
before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 12:16 And he \
entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, \
and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 12:17 And the \
LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai \
Abram's wife. 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou \
hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 12:19 \
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: \
now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 12:20 And Pharaoh \
commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and \
all that he had. 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and \
all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 13:2 And Abram was very \
rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 13:3 And he went on his journeys from \
the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the \
beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he \
had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. \
13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. \
13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: \
for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 13:7 \
And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen \
of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the \
land. 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, \
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be \
brethren. 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray \
thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; \
or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. 13:10 And \
Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well \
watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as \
the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. \
13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and \
they separated themselves the one from the other. 13:12 Abram dwelled in the \
land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his \
tent toward Sodom. 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before \
the LORD exceedingly. 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was \
separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where \
thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all \
the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. \
13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can \
number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. 13:17 \
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; \
for I will give it unto thee. 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and \
dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar \
unto the LORD. 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of \
Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of \
nations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha \
king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the \
king of Bela, which is Zoar. 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale \
of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, \
and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 14:5 And in the fourteenth year \
came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims \
in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh \
Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is \
by the wilderness. 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is \
Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, \
that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and \
the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the \
king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale \
of Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of \
nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings \
with five. 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings \
of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to \
the mountain. 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and \
all their victuals, and went their way. 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's \
brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. 14:13 And \
there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in \
the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and \
these were confederate with Abram. 14:14 And when Abram heard that his \
brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own \
house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. 14:15 And he \
divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, \
and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 14:16 And \
he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and \
his goods, and the women also, and the people. 14:17 And the king of Sodom \
went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and \
of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's \
dale. 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and \
he was the priest of the most high God. 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, \
Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 \
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy \
hand. And he gave him tithes of all. 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto \
Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. 14:22 And Abram \
said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most \
high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, 14:23 That I will not take from \
a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is \
thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that \
which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with \
me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. 15:1 After these \
things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, \
Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. 15:2 And Abram said, \
LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of \
my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou \
hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 15:4 And, \
behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine \
heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine \
heir. 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, \
and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So \
shall thy seed be. 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him \
for righteousness. 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee \
out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 15:8 And he \
said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 15:9 And he \
said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three \
years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young \
pigeon. 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, \
and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 15:11 \
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 15:12 \
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an \
horror of great darkness fell upon him. 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of \
a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and \
shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And \
also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall \
they come out with great substance. 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in \
peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 15:16 But in the fourth \
generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is \
not yet full. 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it \
was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between \
those pieces. 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, \
saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto \
the great river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, \
and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the \
Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, \
and the Jebusites. 16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she \
had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 16:2 And Sarai said unto \
Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go \
in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram \
hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her \
maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and \
gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, \
and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was \
despised in her eyes. 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: \
I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, \
I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. 16:6 But \
Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it \
pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. \
16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the \
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 16:8 And he said, Hagar, \
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I \
flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said \
unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 16:10 \
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed \
exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. 16:11 And the angel \
of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, \
and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. \
16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and \
every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his \
brethren. 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou \
God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? \
16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between \
Kadesh and Bered. 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his \
son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six \
years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. 17:1 And when Abram was ninety \
years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the \
Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 17:2 And I will make my \
covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 17:3 And \
Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4 As for me, \
behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. \
17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be \
Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. 17:6 And I will make \
thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall \
come out of thee. 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee \
and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to \
be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 17:8 And I will give unto \
thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all \
the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. \
17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, \
and thy seed after thee in their generations. 17:10 This is my covenant, \
which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man \
child among you shall be circumcised. 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh \
of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. \
17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man \
child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money \
of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. 17:13 He that is born in thy \
house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and \
my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 17:14 And the \
uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that \
soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 17:15 And \
God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name \
Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee \
a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of \
nations; kings of people shall be of her. 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his \
face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that \
is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? \
17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 17:19 \
And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt \
call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an \
everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. 17:20 And as for Ishmael, \
I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, \
and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will \
make him a great nation. 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, \
which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 17:22 And \
he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 17:23 And Abraham \
took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were \
bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and \
circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said \
unto him. 17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was \
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 17:25 And Ishmael his son was \
thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. \
17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 17:27 \
And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the \
stranger, were circumcised with him. 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in \
the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 \
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when \
he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward \
the ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, \
pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little water, I pray \
you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 18:5 \
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye \
shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So \
do, as thou hast said. 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, \
and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make \
cakes upon the hearth. 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf \
tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. \
18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set \
it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 18:9 \
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the \
tent. 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the \
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in \
the tent door, which was behind him. 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and \
well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of \
women. 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed \
old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 18:13 And the LORD said \
unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a \
child, which am old? 18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time \
appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah \
shall have a son. 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was \
afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 18:16 And the men rose up \
from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring \
them on the way. 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that \
thing which I do; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and \
mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \
18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household \
after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and \
judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of \
him. 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, \
and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down now, and see \
whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come \
unto me; and if not, I will know. 18:22 And the men turned their faces from \
thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 18:23 \
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with \
the wicked? 18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt \
thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are \
therein? 18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the \
righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, \
that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 18:26 \
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I \
will spare all the place for their sakes. 18:27 And Abraham answered and \
said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but \
dust and ashes: 18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty \
righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I \
find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. 18:29 And he spake unto him \
yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he \
said, I will not do it for forty's sake. 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let \
not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be \
found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 18:31 And \
he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: \
Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not \
destroy it for twenty's sake. 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be \
angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found \
there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. 18:33 And the LORD \
went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham \
returned unto his place. 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and \
Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and \
he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold \
now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all \
night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. \
And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 19:3 And he \
pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his \
house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did \
eat. 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of \
Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from \
every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are \
the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may \
know them. 19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door \
after him, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 19:8 \
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray \
you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only \
unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my \
roof. 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow \
came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with \
thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came \
near to break the door. 19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled \
Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 19:11 And they smote the \
men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: \
so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 19:12 And the men said unto \
Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, \
and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For \
we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the \
face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 19:14 And Lot went \
out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, \
Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he \
seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 19:15 And when the morning \
arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy \
two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the \
city. 19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon \
the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being \
merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. \
19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he \
said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the \
plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 19:18 And Lot said unto \
them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in \
thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me \
in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take \
me, and I die: 19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a \
little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul \
shall live. 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning \
this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast \
spoken. 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou \
be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 19:23 The \
sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 19:24 Then the LORD \
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of \
heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the \
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 19:26 But his \
wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 19:27 And \
Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the \
LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land \
of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the \
smoke of a furnace. 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities \
of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of \
the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 19:30 And \
Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters \
with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his \
two daughters. 19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is \
old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner \
of all the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will \
lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 19:33 And they made \
their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with \
her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 19:34 \
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, \
Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this \
night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of \
our father. 19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and \
the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, \
nor when she arose. 19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by \
their father. 19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: \
the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 19:38 And the younger, \
she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of \
the children of Ammon unto this day. 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence \
toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned \
in Gerar. 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and \
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 20:3 But God came to Abimelech \
in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for \
the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 20:4 But Abimelech \
had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous \
nation? 20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself \
said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my \
hands have I done this. 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know \
that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee \
from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 20:7 Now \
therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray \
for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that \
thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. 20:8 Therefore Abimelech \
rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these \
things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 20:9 Then Abimelech \
called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have \
I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? \
thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 20:10 And Abimelech \
said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 20:11 \
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this \
place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 20:12 And yet indeed she is \
my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my \
mother; and she became my wife. 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me \
to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness \
which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of \
me, He is my brother. 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and \
menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him \
Sarah his wife. 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: \
dwell where it pleaseth thee. 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have \
given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a \
covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus \
she was reproved. 20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, \
and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 20:18 For the \
LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of \
Sarah Abraham's wife. 21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the \
LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare \
Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. \
21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom \
Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being \
eight days old, as God had commanded him. 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred \
years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 21:6 And Sarah said, God \
hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. 21:7 And she \
said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children \
suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 21:8 And the child grew, and \
was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was \
weaned. 21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born \
unto Abraham, mocking. 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this \
bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with \
my son, even with Isaac. 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's \
sight because of his son. 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be \
grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in \
all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac \
shall thy seed be called. 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I \
make a nation, because he is thy seed. 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the \
morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, \
putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she \
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 21:15 And the water \
was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. \
21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it \
were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she \
sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 21:17 And God heard \
the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and \
said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the \
voice of the lad where he is. 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in \
thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 21:19 And God opened her \
eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with \
water, and gave the lad drink. 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, \
and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 21:21 And he dwelt in the \
wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. \
21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief \
captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that \
thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not \
deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according \
to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the \
land wherein thou hast sojourned. 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear. 21:25 \
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's \
servants had violently taken away. 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who \
hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, \
but to day. 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto \
Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe \
lambs of the flock by themselves. 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What \
mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 21:30 And he \
said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be \
a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 21:31 Wherefore he called \
that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 21:32 Thus they \
made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief \
captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. \
21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name \
of the LORD, the everlasting God. 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the \
Philistines' land many days. 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, \
that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, \
here I am. 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom \
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a \
burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 22:3 And \
Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of \
his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt \
offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. \
22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar \
off. 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; \
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 22:6 And \
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; \
and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them \
together. 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: \
and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: \
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 22:8 And Abraham said, My son, \
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of \
them together. 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and \
Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his \
son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 22:10 And Abraham stretched \
forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 22:11 And the angel of \
the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he \
said, Here am I. 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither \
do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou \
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. 22:13 And Abraham lifted \
up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by \
his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt \
offering in the stead of his son. 22:14 And Abraham called the name of that \
place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it \
shall be seen. 22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of \
heaven the second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the \
LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, \
thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying \
I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is \
upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 22:18 \
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou \
hast obeyed my voice. 22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they \
rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. 22:20 \
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, \
Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 22:21 Huz \
his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And \
Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 22:23 And Bethuel \
begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 22:24 \
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and \
Thahash, and Maachah. 23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty \
years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 23:2 And Sarah died in \
Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to \
mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 23:3 And Abraham stood up from before \
his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a \
sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I \
may bury my dead out of my sight. 23:5 And the children of Heth answered \
Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince \
among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall \
withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 23:7 \
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to \
the children of Heth. 23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your \
mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me \
to Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, \
which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is \
worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. \
23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite \
answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that \
went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the \
field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the \
presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 23:12 And \
Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 23:13 And he spake \
unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou \
wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; \
take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 23:14 And Ephron answered \
Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth \
four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury \
therefore thy dead. 23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham \
weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons \
of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. \
23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, \
the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the \
field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 23:18 Unto \
Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all \
that went in at the gate of his city. 23:19 And after this, Abraham buried \
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same \
is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 23:20 And the field, and the cave that is \
therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by \
the sons of Heth. 24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the \
LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. 24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest \
servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy \
hand under my thigh: 24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of \
heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son \
of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt \
go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. \
24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be \
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto \
the land from whence thou camest? 24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou \
that thou bring not my son thither again. 24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which \
took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which \
spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this \
land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my \
son from thence. 24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, \
then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither \
again. 24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his \
master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 24:10 And the servant took \
ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of \
his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the \
city of Nahor. 24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by \
a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out \
to draw water. 24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray \
thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. \
24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men \
of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to pass, that the \
damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may \
drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let \
the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby \
shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 24:15 And it came \
to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was \
born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with \
her pitcher upon her shoulder. 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look \
upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, \
and filled her pitcher, and came up. 24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, \
and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 24:18 And \
she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her \
hand, and gave him drink. 24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she \
said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. \
24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again \
unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 24:21 And the man \
wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey \
prosperous or not. 24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done \
drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two \
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose \
daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house \
for us to lodge in? 24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel \
the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 24:25 She said moreover unto \
him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 24:26 And \
the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 24:27 And he said, \
Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my \
master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the \
house of my master's brethren. 24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her \
mother's house these things. 24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name \
was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 24:30 And it came \
to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and \
when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man \
unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at \
the well. 24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore \
standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the \
camels. 24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, \
and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and \
the men's feet that were with him. 24:33 And there was set meat before him to \
eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, \
Speak on. 24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 24:35 And the LORD hath \
blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him \
flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, \
and camels, and asses. 24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my \
master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 24:37 \
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of \
the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 24:38 But thou shalt \
go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. \
24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. \
24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel \
with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my \
kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this \
my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou \
shalt be clear from my oath. 24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and \
said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I \
go: 24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, \
that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I \
pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say to me, \
Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the \
woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. 24:45 And before \
I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her \
pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and \
I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 24:46 And she made haste, and let \
down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy \
camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 24:47 And \
I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of \
Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon \
her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 24:48 And I bowed down my head, \
and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which \
had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his \
son. 24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: \
and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 24:50 \
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: \
we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, \
take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath \
spoken. 24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their \
words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 24:53 And the \
servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and \
gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious \
things. 24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, \
and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me \
away unto my master. 24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the \
damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. \
24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my \
way; send me away that I may go to my master. 24:57 And they said, We will \
call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 24:58 And they called Rebekah, and \
said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 24:59 And \
they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, \
and his men. 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our \
sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess \
the gate of those which hate them. 24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, \
and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took \
Rebekah, and went his way. 24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well \
Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 24:63 And Isaac went out to \
meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, \
and, behold, the camels were coming. 24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, \
and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 24:65 For she had said \
unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And \
the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered \
herself. 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 24:67 \
And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she \
became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's \
death. 25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 25:2 \
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and \
Shuah. 25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were \
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and \
Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of \
Keturah. 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 25:6 But unto the \
sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them \
away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. \
25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an \
hundred threescore and fifteen years. 25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, \
and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered \
to his people. 25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of \
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is \
before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: \
there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 25:11 And it came to pass after \
the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the \
well Lahairoi. 25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, \
whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And these \
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their \
generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and \
Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, \
Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are \
their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according \
to their nations. 25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an \
hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and \
was gathered unto his people. 25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, \
that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the \
presence of all his brethren. 25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, \
Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when \
he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the \
sister to Laban the Syrian. 25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, \
because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his \
wife conceived. 25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she \
said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 25:23 \
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of \
people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be \
stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 25:24 \
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in \
her womb. 25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; \
and they called his name Esau. 25:26 And after that came his brother out, and \
his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac \
was threescore years old when she bare them. 25:27 And the boys grew: and \
Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, \
dwelling in tents. 25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his \
venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came \
from the field, and he was faint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I \
pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name \
called Edom. 25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 25:32 And \
Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this \
birthright do to me? 25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware \
unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau \
bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and \
went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 26:1 And there was a famine \
in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And \
Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 26:2 And the \
LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land \
which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with \
thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all \
these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy \
father; 26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and \
will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the \
nations of the earth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, \
and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 26:6 And Isaac \
dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he \
said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, \
the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look \
upon. 26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that \
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, \
behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 26:9 And Abimelech called \
Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, \
She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for \
her. 26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of \
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have \
brought guiltiness upon us. 26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, \
saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. \
26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an \
hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 26:13 And the man waxed great, and \
went forward, and grew until he became very great: 26:14 For he had \
possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: \
and the Philistines envied him. 26:15 For all the wells which his father's \
servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had \
stopped them, and filled them with earth. 26:16 And Abimelech said unto \
Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 26:17 And Isaac \
departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt \
there. 26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged \
in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after \
the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his \
father had called them. 26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and \
found there a well of springing water. 26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did \
strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the \
name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 26:21 And they digged \
another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. \
26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they \
strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the \
LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 26:23 And \
he went up from thence to Beersheba. 26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the \
same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am \
with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant \
Abraham's sake. 26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name \
of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a \
well. 26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his \
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 26:27 And Isaac said unto \
them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from \
you? 26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and \
we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and \
let us make a covenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we \
have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and \
have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 26:30 And \
he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 26:31 And they rose up \
betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, \
and they departed from him in peace. 26:32 And it came to pass the same day, \
that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had \
digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 26:33 And he called it \
Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 26:34 And \
Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri \
the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 26:35 Which were \
a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 27:1 And it came to pass, that \
when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he \
called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, \
Behold, here am I. 27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day \
of my death: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver \
and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4 And make \
me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my \
soul may bless thee before I die. 27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to \
Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring \
it. 27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy \
father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and make \
me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my \
death. 27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I \
command thee. 27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good \
kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as \
he loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and \
that he may bless thee before his death. 27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his \
mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 \
My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; \
and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 27:13 And his mother \
said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch \
me them. 27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and \
his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 27:15 And Rebekah \
took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, \
and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 27:16 And she put the skins of the \
kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And \
she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the \
hand of her son Jacob. 27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My \
father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 27:19 And Jacob said \
unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou \
badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may \
bless me. 27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found \
it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to \
me. 27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel \
thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 27:22 And Jacob went \
near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's \
voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 27:23 And he discerned him not, \
because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. \
27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 27:25 And he \
said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul \
may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought \
him wine and he drank. 27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near \
now, and kiss me, my son. 27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he \
smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell \
of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 \
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, \
and plenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow \
down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down \
to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that \
blesseth thee. 27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of \
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac \
his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 27:31 And he also \
had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his \
father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may \
bless me. 27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he \
said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 27:33 And Isaac trembled very \
exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought \
it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, \
and he shall be blessed. 27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, \
he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, \
Bless me, even me also, O my father. 27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with \
subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 27:36 And he said, Is not he \
rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away \
my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, \
Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 27:37 And Isaac answered and said \
unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I \
given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and \
what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 27:38 And Esau said unto his father, \
Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. \
And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 27:39 And Isaac his father answered \
and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, \
and of the dew of heaven from above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, \
and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have \
the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 27:41 And \
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: \
and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; \
then will I slay my brother Jacob. 27:42 And these words of Esau her elder \
son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and \
said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort \
himself, purposing to kill thee. 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; \
arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few \
days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger \
turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I \
will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you \
both in one day? 27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life \
because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of \
Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall \
my life do me? 28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, \
and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. \
28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and \
take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. \
28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, \
that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee the blessing of \
Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the \
land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 28:5 And Isaac \
sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the \
Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 28:6 When Esau saw \
that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a \
wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, \
Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob \
obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau \
seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then \
went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the \
daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. \
28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 28:11 And he \
lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun \
was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his \
pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 28:12 And he dreamed, and \
behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and \
behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 28:13 And, behold, \
the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, \
and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, \
and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and \
thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and \
to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth \
be blessed. 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all \
places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I \
will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. \
28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in \
this place; and I knew it not. 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How \
dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is \
the gate of heaven. 28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took \
the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and \
poured oil upon the top of it. 28:19 And he called the name of that place \
Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 28:20 And \
Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this \
way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 28:21 So \
that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my \
God: 28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's \
house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto \
thee. 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the \
people of the east. 29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, \
lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they \
watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 29:3 And \
thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the \
well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's \
mouth in his place. 29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? \
And they said, Of Haran are we. 29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the \
son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 29:6 And he said unto them, Is he \
well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with \
the sheep. 29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that \
the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed \
them. 29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered \
together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water \
the sheep. 29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her \
father's sheep; for she kept them. 29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw \
Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his \
mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's \
mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 29:11 And Jacob \
kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel \
that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran \
and told her father. 29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings \
of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and \
kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. \
29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he \
abode with him the space of a month. 29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because \
thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, \
what shall thy wages be? 29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the \
elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 29:17 Leah was tender \
eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 29:18 And Jacob loved \
Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger \
daughter. 29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than \
that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 29:20 And Jacob served \
seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love \
he had to her. 29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days \
are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 29:22 And Laban gathered together \
all the men of the place, and made a feast. 29:23 And it came to pass in the \
evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went \
in unto her. 29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for \
an handmaid. 29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was \
Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I \
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 29:26 And \
Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before \
the firstborn. 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the \
service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 29:28 And Jacob \
did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife \
also. 29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be \
her maid. 29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel \
more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 29:31 And when the \
LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. \
29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for \
she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my \
husband will love me. 29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and \
said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me \
this son also: and she called his name Simeon. 29:34 And she conceived again, \
and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, \
because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 29:35 \
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the \
LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. 30:1 And when \
Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and \
said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 30:2 And Jacob's anger was \
kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld \
from thee the fruit of the womb? 30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go \
in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children \
by her. 30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in \
unto her. 30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 30:6 And Rachel \
said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a \
son: therefore called she his name Dan. 30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid \
conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 30:8 And Rachel said, With \
great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and \
she called his name Naphtali. 30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, \
she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 30:10 And Zilpah Leah's \
maid bare Jacob a son. 30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called \
his name Gad. 30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 30:13 And \
Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called \
his name Asher. 30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found \
mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel \
said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 30:15 And she \
said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and \
wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore \
he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 30:16 And Jacob came \
out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, \
Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's \
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, \
and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 30:18 And Leah said, God \
hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she \
called his name Issachar. 30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the \
sixth son. 30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now \
will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she \
called his name Zebulun. 30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called \
her name Dinah. 30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, \
and opened her womb. 30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God \
hath taken away my reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, \
The LORD shall add to me another son. 30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel \
had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto \
mine own place, and to my country. 30:26 Give me my wives and my children, \
for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which \
I have done thee. 30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found \
favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD \
hath blessed me for thy sake. 30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I \
will give it. 30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served \
thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 30:30 For it was little which thou \
hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD \
hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own \
house also? 30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou \
shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again \
feed and keep thy flock. 30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, \
removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown \
cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of \
such shall be my hire. 30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time \
to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is \
not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that \
shall be counted stolen with me. 30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it \
might be according to thy word. 30:35 And he removed that day the he goats \
that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled \
and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among \
the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 30:36 And he set three \
days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's \
flocks. 30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and \
chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear \
which was in the rods. 30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before \
the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to \
drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 30:39 And the \
flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, \
speckled, and spotted. 30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the \
faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of \
Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's \
cattle. 30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did \
conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the \
gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 30:42 But when the cattle \
were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the \
stronger Jacob's. 30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much \
cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. 31:1 And he \
heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was \
our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this \
glory. 31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was \
not toward him as before. 31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the \
land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 31:4 And \
Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 31:5 And \
said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as \
before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 31:6 And ye know that \
with all my power I have served your father. 31:7 And your father hath \
deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt \
me. 31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the \
cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; \
then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 31:9 Thus God hath taken away the \
cattle of your father, and given them to me. 31:10 And it came to pass at the \
time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a \
dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, \
speckled, and grisled. 31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, \
saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine \
eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, \
speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 31:13 \
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou \
vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return \
unto the land of thy kindred. 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said \
unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's \
house? 31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and \
hath quite devoured also our money. 31:16 For all the riches which God hath \
taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever \
God hath said unto thee, do. 31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and \
his wives upon camels; 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his \
goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in \
Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 31:19 And \
Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her \
father's. 31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he \
told him not that he fled. 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose \
up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. \
31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 31:23 And \
he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and \
they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian \
in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to \
Jacob either good or bad. 31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had \
pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the \
mount of Gilead. 31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that \
thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as \
captives taken with the sword? 31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, \
and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee \
away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 31:28 And hast \
not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done \
foolishly in so doing. 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: \
but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed \
that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 31:30 And now, though thou \
wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, \
yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 31:31 And Jacob answered and said to \
Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by \
force thy daughters from me. 31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let \
him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and \
take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 31:33 And \
Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two \
maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, \
and entered into Rachel's tent. 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and \
put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all \
the tent, but found them not. 31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not \
displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women \
is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. 31:36 And Jacob was \
wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my \
trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 31:37 \
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy \
household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they \
may judge betwixt us both. 31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy \
ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock \
have I not eaten. 31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto \
thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen \
by day, or stolen by night. 31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed \
me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 31:41 Thus \
have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy \
two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages \
ten times. 31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the \
fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. \
God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee \
yesternight. 31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters \
are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my \
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto \
these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 31:44 Now \
therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a \
witness between me and thee. 31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for \
a pillar. 31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they \
took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 31:47 \
And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 31:48 And \
Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore \
was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD \
watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 31:50 If thou \
shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my \
daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 31:51 \
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I \
have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be \
witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not \
pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 31:53 The God of \
Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And \
Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 31:54 Then Jacob offered \
sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did \
eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. 31:55 And early in the morning \
Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and \
Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 32:1 And Jacob went on his way, \
and the angels of God met him. 32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is \
God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 32:3 And Jacob \
sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the \
country of Edom. 32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto \
my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and \
stayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and \
menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may \
find grace in thy sight. 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \
We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four \
hundred men with him. 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and \
he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the \
camels, into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and \
smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 32:9 And Jacob \
said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which \
saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal \
well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of \
all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I \
passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 32:11 Deliver me, I \
pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear \
him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 32:12 \
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of \
the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 32:13 And he lodged there \
that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau \
his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred \
ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty \
kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 32:16 And he delivered \
them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto \
his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. \
32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth \
thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and \
whose are these before thee? 32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant \
Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is \
behind us. 32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that \
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye \
find him. 32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. \
For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and \
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 32:21 So \
went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the \
company. 32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two \
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 32:23 \
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. \
32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the \
breaking of the day. 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, \
he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out \
of joint, as he wrestled with him. 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day \
breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 32:27 \
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 32:28 And he \
said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince \
hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 32:29 And Jacob \
asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore \
is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 32:30 And \
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, \
and my life is preserved. 32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose \
upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 32:32 Therefore the children of \
Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the \
thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the \
sinew that shrank. 33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, \
behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children \
unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 33:2 And he put the \
handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and \
Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed \
himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 33:4 \
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed \
him: and they wept. 33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the \
children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which \
God hath graciously given thy servant. 33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, \
they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 33:7 And Leah also with \
her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and \
Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all \
this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of \
my lord. 33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast \
unto thyself. 33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found \
grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have \
seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased \
with me. 33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; \
because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he \
urged him, and he took it. 33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and \
let us go, and I will go before thee. 33:13 And he said unto him, My lord \
knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are \
with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. \
33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead \
on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be \
able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 33:15 And Esau said, Let \
me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What \
needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 33:16 So Esau returned \
that day on his way unto Seir. 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and \
built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the \
place is called Succoth. 33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, \
which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his \
tent before the city. 33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had \
spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for \
an hundred pieces of money. 33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called \
it EleloheIsrael. 34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto \
Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 34:2 And when Shechem the \
son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay \
with her, and defiled her. 34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of \
Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 34:4 And \
Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 34:5 \
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were \
with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. \
34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. \
34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the \
men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in \
Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 34:8 \
And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for \
your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 34:9 And make ye marriages \
with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. \
34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and \
trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 34:11 And Shechem said \
unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and \
what ye shall say unto me I will give. 34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and \
gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the \
damsel to wife. 34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his \
father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: \
34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to \
one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 34:15 But in \
this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you \
be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will \
take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one \
people. 34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then \
will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 34:18 And their words pleased \
Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 34:19 And the young man deferred not to do \
the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more \
honourable than all the house of his father. 34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his \
son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their \
city, saying, 34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell \
in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for \
them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our \
daughters. 34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with \
us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are \
circumcised. 34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast \
of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with \
us. 34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out \
of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of \
the gate of his city. 34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they \
were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, \
took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the \
males. 34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the \
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 34:27 The sons of \
Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled \
their sister. 34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, \
and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And \
all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they \
captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 34:30 And Jacob said to \
Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the \
inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being \
few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; \
and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 34:31 And they said, Should he deal \
with our sister as with an harlot? 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up \
to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared \
unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 35:2 Then \
Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the \
strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 35:3 \
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto \
God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way \
which I went. 35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were \
in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid \
them under the oak which was by Shechem. 35:5 And they journeyed: and the \
terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did \
not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in \
the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with \
him. 35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because \
there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 35:8 \
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an \
oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 35:9 And God appeared unto \
Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. 35:10 And God \
said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more \
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 35:11 And \
God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and \
a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; \
35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, \
and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 35:13 And God went up from \
him in the place where he talked with him. 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in \
the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a \
drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 35:15 And Jacob called the \
name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 35:16 And they journeyed \
from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel \
travailed, and she had hard labour. 35:17 And it came to pass, when she was \
in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have \
this son also. 35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for \
she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him \
Benjamin. 35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which \
is Bethlehem. 35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar \
of Rachel's grave unto this day. 35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his \
tent beyond the tower of Edar. 35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt \
in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: \
and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of \
Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and \
Issachar, and Zebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 \
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the \
sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, \
which were born to him in Padanaram. 35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his \
father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and \
Isaac sojourned. 35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore \
years. 35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his \
people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. \
36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 36:2 Esau took his \
wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and \
Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And \
Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 36:4 And Adah bare to Esau \
Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and \
Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in \
the land of Canaan. 36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his \
daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his \
beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and \
went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 36:7 For their \
riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein \
they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 36:8 Thus \
dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 36:9 And these are the generations of \
Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of \
Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of \
Bashemath the wife of Esau. 36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, \
Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's \
son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. \
36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and \
Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 36:14 And these were \
the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's \
wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. 36:15 These were \
dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; \
duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, \
and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of \
Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel \
Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the \
dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath \
Esau's wife. 36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke \
Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah \
the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is \
Edom, and these are their dukes. 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, \
who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 36:21 And \
Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the \
children of Seir in the land of Edom. 36:22 And the children of Lotan were \
Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 36:23 And the children of \
Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 36:24 And \
these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah \
that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his \
father. 36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the \
daughter of Anah. 36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and \
Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, \
and Zaavan, and Akan. 36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. \
36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, \
duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are \
the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 36:31 And \
these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned \
any king over the children of Israel. 36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned \
in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 36:33 And Bela died, and \
Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 36:34 And Jobab died, \
and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 36:35 And Husham died, \
and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in \
his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 36:36 And Hadad died, and \
Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of \
Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 36:38 And Saul died, and \
Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 36:39 And Baalhanan the son \
of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was \
Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter \
of Mezahab. 36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, \
according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, \
duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 36:42 \
Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be \
the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their \
possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites. 37:1 And Jacob dwelt in \
the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 37:2 These \
are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding \
the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and \
with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his \
father their evil report. 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his \
children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of \
many colours. 37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more \
than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto \
him. 37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they \
hated him yet the more. 37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this \
dream which I have dreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the \
field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your \
sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 37:8 And his \
brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed \
have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and \
for his words. 37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his \
brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun \
and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 37:10 And he told it \
to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto \
him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and \
thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 37:11 \
And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 37:12 And \
his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 37:13 And Israel \
said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I \
will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 37:14 And he said to \
him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with \
the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of \
Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 37:15 And a certain man found him, and, \
behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What \
seekest thou? 37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, \
where they feed their flocks. 37:17 And the man said, They are departed \
hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his \
brethren, and found them in Dothan. 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, \
even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. \
37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 37:20 Come \
now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will \
say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of \
his dreams. 37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their \
hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed \
no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no \
hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to \
his father again. 37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his \
brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours \
that was on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the \
pit was empty, there was no water in it. 37:25 And they sat down to eat \
bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of \
Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and \
myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 37:26 And Judah said unto his \
brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? \
37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be \
upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. \
37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted \
up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty \
pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 37:29 And Reuben \
returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent \
his clothes. 37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is \
not; and I, whither shall I go? 37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed \
a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And they sent the \
coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This \
have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 37:33 And he knew \
it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is \
without doubt rent in pieces. 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put \
sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 37:35 And all \
his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be \
comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son \
mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 37:36 And the Midianites sold him \
into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. \
38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his \
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 38:2 \
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; \
and he took her, and went in unto her. 38:3 And she conceived, and bare a \
son; and he called his name Er. 38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; \
and she called his name Onan. 38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a \
son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. \
38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 38:7 \
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD \
slew him. 38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and \
marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 38:9 And Onan knew that the seed \
should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's \
wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his \
brother. 38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he \
slew him also. 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a \
widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest \
peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in \
her father's house. 38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah \
Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his \
sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 38:13 And \
it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to \
shear his sheep. 38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and \
covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which \
is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not \
given unto him to wife. 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an \
harlot; because she had covered her face. 38:16 And he turned unto her by the \
way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not \
that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that \
thou mayest come in unto me? 38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from \
the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 38:18 \
And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy \
bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came \
in unto her, and she conceived by him. 38:19 And she arose, and went away, \
and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. \
38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to \
receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 38:21 Then he \
asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by \
the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 38:22 And he \
returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place \
said, that there was no harlot in this place. 38:23 And Judah said, Let her \
take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not \
found her. 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was \
told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and \
also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, \
and let her be burnt. 38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her \
father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she \
said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and \
staff. 38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more \
righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew \
her again no more. 38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, \
that, behold, twins were in her womb. 38:28 And it came to pass, when she \
travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon \
his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 38:29 And it came to \
pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she \
said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his \
name was called Pharez. 38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had \
the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 39:1 And \
Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, \
captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the \
Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 39:2 And the LORD was with \
Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master \
the Egyptian. 39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that \
the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 39:4 And Joseph found \
grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his \
house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 39:5 And it came to pass \
from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that \
he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the \
blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. \
39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he \
had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and \
well favoured. 39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's \
wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 39:8 But he \
refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what \
is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; \
39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back \
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this \
great wickedness, and sin against God? 39:10 And it came to pass, as she \
spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or \
to be with her. 39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went \
into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house \
there within. 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: \
and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 39:13 And it \
came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was \
fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto \
them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came \
in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came \
to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his \
garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 39:16 And she laid up his garment \
by her, until his lord came home. 39:17 And she spake unto him according to \
these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, \
came in unto me to mock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my \
voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 39:19 And it \
came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake \
unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was \
kindled. 39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a \
place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. \
39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour \
in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 39:22 And the keeper of the prison \
committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and \
whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 39:23 The keeper of the \
prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was \
with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 40:1 And it \
came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his \
baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth \
against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against \
the chief of the bakers. 40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the \
captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 40:4 \
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: \
and they continued a season in ward. 40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of \
them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the \
interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, \
which were bound in the prison. 40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the \
morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 40:7 And he asked \
Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, \
saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 40:8 And they said unto him, We \
have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto \
them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. 40:9 \
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, \
behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and \
it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters \
thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: \
and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the \
cup into Pharaoh's hand. 40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the \
interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within \
three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: \
and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner \
when thou wast his butler. 40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with \
thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto \
Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away \
out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they \
should put me into the dungeon. 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the \
interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, \
behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost \
basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did \
eat them out of the basket upon my head. 40:18 And Joseph answered and said, \
This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 \
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall \
hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. 40:20 \
And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made \
a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler \
and of the chief baker among his servants. 40:21 And he restored the chief \
butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: \
40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 40:23 \
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 41:1 And it \
came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, \
he stood by the river. 41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven \
well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 41:3 And, \
behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured \
and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. \
41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well \
favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 41:5 And he slept and dreamed the \
second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and \
good. 41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung \
up after them. 41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full \
ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 41:8 And it came to \
pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for \
all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told \
them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. \
41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my \
faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in \
ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 41:11 \
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according \
to the interpretation of his dream. 41:12 And there was there with us a young \
man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he \
interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did \
interpret. 41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me \
he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and \
called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved \
himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 41:15 And Pharaoh \
said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can \
interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a \
dream to interpret it. 41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not \
in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 41:17 And Pharaoh said unto \
Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 41:18 And, \
behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well \
favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came \
up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never \
saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill \
favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had \
eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were \
still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 41:22 And I saw in my \
dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 41:23 \
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, \
sprung up after them: 41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: \
and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it \
to me. 41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God \
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 41:26 The seven good kine are \
seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 41:27 \
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven \
years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven \
years of famine. 41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: \
What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 41:29 Behold, there come \
seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 41:30 And there \
shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be \
forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 \
And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine \
following; for it shall be very grievous. 41:32 And for that the dream was \
doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, \
and God will shortly bring it to pass. 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look \
out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 41:34 Let \
Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the \
fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 41:35 And let \
them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under \
the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 41:36 And that \
food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which \
shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. \
41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all \
his servants. 41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a \
one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 41:39 And Pharaoh said \
unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so \
discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and \
according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will \
I be greater than thou. 41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set \
thee over all the land of Egypt. 41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his \
hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine \
linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in \
the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and \
he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 41:44 And Pharaoh said unto \
Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot \
in all the land of Egypt. 41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name \
Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah \
priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 41:46 And \
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And \
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the \
land of Egypt. 41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth \
by handfuls. 41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which \
were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of \
the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 41:49 \
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left \
numbering; for it was without number. 41:50 And unto Joseph were born two \
sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of \
Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 41:51 And Joseph called the name of \
the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, \
and all my father's house. 41:52 And the name of the second called he \
Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. \
41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, \
were ended. 41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as \
Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of \
Egypt there was bread. 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the \
people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, \
Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 41:56 And the famine was over all \
the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto \
the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 41:57 And all \
countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine \
was so sore in all lands. 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in \
Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 42:2 And he \
said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, \
and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 42:3 And Joseph's \
ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's \
brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure \
mischief befall him. 42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those \
that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 42:6 And Joseph was the \
governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the \
land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with \
their faces to the earth. 42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, \
but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said \
unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy \
food. 42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 42:9 And \
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye \
are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 42:10 And they said \
unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 42:11 We are \
all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 42:12 And he \
said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 42:13 \
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the \
land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and \
one is not. 42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto \
you, saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of \
Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come \
hither. 42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall \
be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth \
in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 42:17 And he put \
them all together into ward three days. 42:18 And Joseph said unto them the \
third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let \
one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn \
for the famine of your houses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; \
so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 42:21 \
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in \
that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not \
hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 42:22 And Reuben answered \
them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and \
ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 42:23 And \
they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an \
interpreter. 42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and \
returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, \
and bound him before their eyes. 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their \
sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give \
them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 42:26 And they laded \
their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 42:27 And as one of them \
opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; \
for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 42:28 And he said unto his brethren, \
My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed \
them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath \
done unto us? 42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of \
Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is \
the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the \
country. 42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 \
We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is \
this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 42:33 And the man, the lord \
of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave \
one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your \
households, and be gone: 42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then \
shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I \
deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 42:35 And it \
came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of \
money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of \
money, they were afraid. 42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have \
ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will \
take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 42:37 And Reuben spake \
unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: \
deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 42:38 And he \
said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is \
left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall \
ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 43:1 And the famine was \
sore in the land. 43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn \
which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, \
buy us a little food. 43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did \
solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your \
brother be with you. 43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go \
down and buy thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go \
down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother \
be with you. 43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to \
tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 43:7 And they said, The man asked \
us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet \
alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of \
these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother \
down? 43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and \
we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and \
also our little ones. 43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou \
require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let \
me bear the blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we \
had returned this second time. 43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, \
If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your \
vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, \
spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your \
hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry \
it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take also your \
brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God Almighty give you \
mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. \
If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. 43:15 And the men took that \
present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, \
and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 43:16 And when Joseph saw \
Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, \
and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. 43:17 And \
the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. \
43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; \
and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the \
first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall \
upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 43:19 And they came near to \
the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the \
house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy \
food: 43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our \
sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money \
in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 43:22 And other \
money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put \
our money in our sacks. 43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your \
God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had \
your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 43:24 And the man brought \
the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; \
and he gave their asses provender. 43:25 And they made ready the present \
against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. \
43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in \
their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 43:27 \
And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old \
man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 43:28 And they answered, Thy servant \
our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their \
heads, and made obeisance. 43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his \
brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, \
of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. \
43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and \
he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. \
43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, \
Set on bread. 43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by \
themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: \
because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an \
abomination unto the Egyptians. 43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn \
according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the \
men marvelled one at another. 43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them \
from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of \
their's. And they drank, and were merry with him. 44:1 And he commanded the \
steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they \
can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 44:2 And put my \
cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. \
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 44:3 As soon as the \
morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 44:4 And \
when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto \
his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say \
unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 44:5 Is not this it in \
which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in \
so doing. 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. \
44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid \
that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8 Behold, the money, \
which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the \
land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or \
gold? 44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and \
we also will be my lord's bondmen. 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be \
according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and \
ye shall be blameless. 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack \
to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 44:12 And he searched, and \
began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in \
Benjamin's sack. 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his \
ass, and returned to the city. 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to \
Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. \
44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye \
not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 44:16 And Judah said, What \
shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear \
ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my \
lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 44:17 And \
he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is \
found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your \
father. 44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy \
servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger \
burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 44:19 My lord asked \
his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 44:20 And we said unto \
my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little \
one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his \
father loveth him. 44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down \
unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 44:22 And we said unto my lord, \
The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his \
father would die. 44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your \
youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 44:24 And \
it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the \
words of my lord. 44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little \
food. 44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with \
us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our \
youngest brother be with us. 44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye \
know that my wife bare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I \
said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye \
take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray \
hairs with sorrow to the grave. 44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy \
servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound \
up in the lad's life; 44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad \
is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray \
hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 44:32 For thy \
servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not \
unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 44:33 Now \
therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to \
my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 44:34 For how shall I go up \
to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil \
that shall come on my father. 45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself \
before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out \
from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known \
unto his brethren. 45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of \
Pharaoh heard. 45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my \
father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were \
troubled at his presence. 45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near \
to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, \
whom ye sold into Egypt. 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with \
yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to \
preserve life. 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and \
yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor \
harvest. 45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the \
earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 45:8 So now it was not \
you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, \
and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 45:9 \
Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son \
Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: \
45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto \
me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and \
thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for \
yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all \
that thou hast, come to poverty. 45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the \
eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. \
45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that \
ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 45:14 And \
he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon \
his neck. 45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and \
after that his brethren talked with him. 45:16 And the fame thereof was heard \
in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased \
Pharaoh well, and his servants. 45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto \
thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of \
Canaan; 45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and \
I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of \
the land. 45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of \
the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your \
father, and come. 45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the \
land of Egypt is your's. 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph \
gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them \
provision for the way. 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of \
raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five \
changes of raiment. 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten \
asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn \
and bread and meat for his father by the way. 45:24 So he sent his brethren \
away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by \
the way. 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of \
Canaan unto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet \
alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart \
fainted, for he believed them not. 45:27 And they told him all the words of \
Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph \
had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And \
Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him \
before I die. 46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came \
to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 46:2 \
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, \
Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy \
father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great \
nation: 46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely \
bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 46:5 And \
Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their \
father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh \
had sent to carry him. 46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, \
which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and \
all his seed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his \
daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into \
Egypt. 46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came \
into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 46:9 And the sons \
of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 46:10 And the sons of \
Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son \
of a Canaanitish woman. 46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and \
Merari. 46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, \
and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez \
were Hezron and Hamul. 46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and \
Job, and Shimron. 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and \
Jahleel. 46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in \
Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his \
daughters were thirty and three. 46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and \
Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 46:17 And the sons of \
Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and \
the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, \
whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even \
sixteen souls. 46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. \
46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, \
which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 46:21 \
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and \
Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 46:22 These are the sons \
of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 46:23 And \
the sons of Dan; Hushim. 46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, \
and Jezer, and Shillem. 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave \
unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were \
seven. 46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of \
his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and \
six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two \
souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were \
threescore and ten. 46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct \
his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 46:29 And Joseph \
made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and \
presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a \
good while. 46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have \
seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. 46:31 And Joseph said unto his \
brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and \
say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of \
Canaan, are come unto me; 46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade \
hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their \
herds, and all that they have. 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh \
shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 46:34 That ye shall \
say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until \
now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; \
for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 47:1 Then Joseph \
came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, \
and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; \
and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 47:2 And he took some of his \
brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 47:3 And Pharaoh \
said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, \
Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 47:4 They said \
morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy \
servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land \
of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of \
Goshen. 47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy \
brethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the \
best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen \
let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make \
them rulers over my cattle. 47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and \
set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto \
Jacob, How old art thou? 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the \
years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the \
days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the \
years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 47:10 And \
Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 47:11 And Joseph \
placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of \
Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had \
commanded. 47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all \
his father's household, with bread, according to their families. 47:13 And \
there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the \
land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. \
47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of \
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph \
brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 47:15 And when money failed in the \
land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, \
and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money \
faileth. 47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for \
your cattle, if money fail. 47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: \
and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and \
for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread \
for all their cattle for that year. 47:18 When that year was ended, they came \
unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my \
lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; \
there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our \
lands: 47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? \
buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto \
Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be \
not desolate. 47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for \
the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over \
them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 47:21 And as for the people, he removed \
them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end \
thereof. 47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests \
had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which \
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 47:23 Then Joseph \
said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for \
Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 47:24 And it \
shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto \
Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for \
your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little \
ones. 47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in \
the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 47:26 And Joseph \
made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have \
the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not \
Pharaoh's. 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of \
Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied \
exceedingly. 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so \
the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. 47:29 And the \
time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said \
unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand \
under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, \
in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out \
of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou \
hast said. 47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And \
Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. 48:1 And it came to pass after \
these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took \
with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 48:2 And one told Jacob, and \
said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened \
himself, and sat upon the bed. 48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty \
appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said \
unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will \
make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after \
thee for an everlasting possession. 48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and \
Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto \
thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 48:6 And \
thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be \
called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 48:7 And as for \
me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the \
way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried \
her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. 48:8 And Israel \
beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 48:9 And Joseph said unto his \
father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, \
Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 48:10 Now the eyes \
of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them \
near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 48:11 And Israel said \
unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me \
also thy seed. 48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and \
he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 48:13 And Joseph took them both, \
Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left \
hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 48:14 And \
Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was \
the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands \
wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and \
said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which \
fed me all my life long unto this day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from \
all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of \
my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst \
of the earth. 48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand \
upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's \
hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 48:18 And Joseph \
said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy \
right hand upon his head. 48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, \
my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: \
but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall \
become a multitude of nations. 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In \
thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: \
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, \
Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land \
of your fathers. 48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy \
brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with \
my bow. 49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves \
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. \
49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto \
Israel your father. 49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the \
beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of \
power: 49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up \
to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 49:5 \
Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their \
habitations. 49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their \
assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a \
man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. 49:7 Cursed be their \
anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide \
them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy \
brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy \
father's children shall bow down before thee. 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: \
from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a \
lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? 49:10 The sceptre shall not \
depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; \
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 49:11 Binding his foal \
unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his \
garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes \
shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 49:13 Zebulun shall \
dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his \
border shall be unto Zidon. 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down \
between two burdens: 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that \
it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto \
tribute. 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. \
49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth \
the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 49:18 I have waited \
for thy salvation, O LORD. 49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he \
shall overcome at the last. 49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he \
shall yield royal dainties. 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth \
goodly words. 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a \
well; whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely grieved \
him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and \
the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of \
Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 49:25 Even by the \
God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless \
thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, \
blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father \
have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of \
the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown \
of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 49:27 Benjamin shall \
ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he \
shall divide the spoil. 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and \
this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one \
according to his blessing he blessed them. 49:29 And he charged them, and \
said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers \
in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave \
that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of \
Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a \
possession of a buryingplace. 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his \
wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. \
49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the \
children of Heth. 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his \
sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was \
gathered unto his people. 50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and \
wept upon him, and kissed him. 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the \
physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 50:3 And \
forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those \
which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten \
days. 50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the \
house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I \
pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made me swear, \
saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of \
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, \
and bury my father, and I will come again. 50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and \
bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 50:7 And Joseph went up to \
bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders \
of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house \
of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, \
and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 50:9 And \
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great \
company. 50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond \
Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he \
made a mourning for his father seven days. 50:11 And when the inhabitants of \
the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, \
This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was \
called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 50:12 And his sons did unto him \
according as he commanded them: 50:13 For his sons carried him into the land \
of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which \
Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron \
the Hittite, before Mamre. 50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his \
brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had \
buried his father. 50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was \
dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite \
us all the evil which we did unto him. 50:16 And they sent a messenger unto \
Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall \
ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, \
and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive \
the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when \
they spake unto him. 50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before \
his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 50:19 And Joseph said \
unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 50:20 But as for you, ye \
thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it \
is this day, to save much people alive. 50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I \
will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake \
kindly unto them. 50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's \
house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 50:23 And Joseph saw \
Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the \
son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 50:24 And Joseph said \
unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of \
this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. \
50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will \
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 50:26 So Joseph \
died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was \
put in a coffin in Egypt.", "CreationDate" ->

          "I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE Alice was beginning to get very tired of \
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice \
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures \
or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \
\"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind \
(as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink \
eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did \
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took \
a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out \
of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was \
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In \
another moment, down went Alice after it! The rabbit-hole went straight on \
like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that \
Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found \
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Either the well was \
very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went \
down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well \
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and \
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one \
of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to \
her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so \
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Down, down, \
down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so \
Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I \
should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of \
milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice \
felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon \
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit \
hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark \
overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still \
in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went \
Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a \
corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close \
behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of \
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they \
were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she \
was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of \
solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first \
idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! \
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, \
it would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came \
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little \
door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, \
and to her great delight, it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it \
led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and \
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she \
longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of \
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a \
telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" Alice went back to \
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a \
book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a \
little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice), \
and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \
\"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. \"No, I'll look \
first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not,\" for she \
had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is \
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle \
was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it \
very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, \
roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. * \
* * * * \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like \
a telescope!\" And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and \
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \
going through the little door into that lovely garden. After awhile, finding \
that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; \
but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had \
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, \
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly \
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the \
table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with \
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \"Come, there's no use in \
crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I advise you to \
leave off this minute!\" She generally gave herself very good advice (though \
she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely \
as to bring tears into her eyes. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that \
was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, \
on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, \
I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the \
key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either \
way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" She ate a \
little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding \
her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she \
was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to \
work and very soon finished off the cake. II--THE POOL OF TEARS \"Curiouser \
and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment \
she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm opening out like the \
largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I \
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall \
be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\" Just at this \
moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now \
rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden \
key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she \
could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one \
eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began \
to cry again. She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large \
pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall. After a time, she heard \
a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to \
see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, \
with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He \
came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the \
Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\" \
When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you \
please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves \
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice \
took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went \
on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday \
things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got up this morning? \
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, \
_that's_ the great puzzle!\" As she said this, she looked down at her hands \
and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white \
kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she \
thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table \
to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and \
was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was \
the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save \
herself from shrinking away altogether. \"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said \
Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find \
herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And she ran with all \
speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and \
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are \
worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this \
before, never!\" As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another \
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that \
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was \
in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. Just \
then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and \
she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a \
mouse that had slipped in like herself. \"Would it be of any use, now,\" \
thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down \
here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no \
harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this \
pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at \
her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little \
eyes, but it said nothing. \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought \
Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the \
Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O\[CapitalATilde]\.b9 est ma chatte?\" \
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a \
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, \
I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor \
animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\" \"Not like \
cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like \
cats, if you were me?\" \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \
\"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I \
think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a \
dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it \
must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather \
not.\" \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of \
its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ \
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\" \"I \
won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of \
conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice \
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats \
and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended \
it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, \
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly \
after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or \
dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned \
'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in \
a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my \
history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\" It was high \
time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals \
that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, \
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party \
swam to the shore. III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE They were indeed a \
queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled \
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping \
wet, cross and uncomfortable. The first question, of course, was how to get \
dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it \
seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, \
as if she had known them all her life. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a \
person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and \
listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, \
in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with \
an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. \
Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was \
favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted \
leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. \
Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\" \"Ugh!\" said the \
Lory, with a shiver. \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of \
Canterbury, found it advisable'--\" \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck. \"Found \
_it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' \
means.\" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said \
the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the \
archbishop find?\" The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went \
on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and \
offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, \
turning to Alice as it spoke. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy \
tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"In that case,\" said the Dodo \
solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the \
immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"Speak English!\" said the \
Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's \
more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the \
Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a \
Caucus-race.\" \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice. \"Why,\" said the \
Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a \
race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along \
the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but \
they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it \
was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been \
running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called \
out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and \
asking, \"But who has won?\" This question the Dodo could not answer without \
a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ \
must have prizes.\" \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of \
voices asked. \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice \
with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, \
in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\" Alice had no idea what to do, and in \
despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits \
(luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as \
prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round. The next thing was to eat \
the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds \
complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and \
had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down \
again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \"You \
promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you \
hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be \
offended again. \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to \
Alice and sighing. \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking \
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she \
kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of \
the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in \
the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll \
take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing \
to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or \
judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said \
cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" \
\"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you \
thinking of?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got \
to the fifth bend, I think?\" \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" \
said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \"Please come back and finish \
your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \
\"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked \
a little quicker. \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This \
caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off \
at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \
\"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various \
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone. \"I wish I hadn't \
mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the \
best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very \
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little \
pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly. IV--THE \
RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back \
again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; \
Alice heard it muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear \
paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are \
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a \
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and \
she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere \
to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and \
the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished \
completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an \
angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this \
moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\" \"He took me \
for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be \
when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little \
house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. \
RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, \
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the \
house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time, Alice had found \
her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan \
and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a \
pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell \
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and \
put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large \
again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" \
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the \
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put \
down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any \
more.\" Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing \
and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, \
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up \
the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. \
What _will_ become of me?\" Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had \
now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard \
a voice outside and stopped to listen. \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the \
voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Then came a little pattering of \
feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and \
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now \
about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid \
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as \
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that \
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll go 'round \
and get in at the window.\" \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after \
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she \
suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get \
hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of \
broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had \
fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort. Next came an angry \
voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And then a voice she had \
never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\" \
\"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the \
window?\" \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\" \"Well, it's got no business \
there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" There was a long silence after \
this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread \
out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were \
_two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll \
do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish \
they _could_!\" She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At \
last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many \
voices all talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other \
ladder? Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to \
go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master \
says you've got to go down the chimney!\" Alice drew her foot as far down the \
chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and \
scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick \
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a \
general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch \
him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence and then another confusion of \
voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--What happened to \
you?\" Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No \
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me like a \
Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" After a minute or two of \
silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A \
barrowful will do, to begin with.\" \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. \
But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles \
came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice \
noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little \
cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I \
eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in \
my size.\" So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that \
she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through \
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals \
and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she \
appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in \
a thick wood. \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as \
she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the \
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to \
eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'\" Alice \
looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could \
not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the \
circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same \
height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the \
edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was \
sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and \
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. V--ADVICE FROM A \
CATERPILLAR At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and \
addressed Alice in a languid, sleepy voice. \"Who are _you_?\" said the \
Caterpillar. Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at \
present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think \
I must have changed several times since then.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \
said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain yourself!\" \"I can't explain \
_myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm not myself, you \
see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\" She drew \
herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you ought to tell me who _you_ \
are, first.\" \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar. As Alice could not think of any \
good reason and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of \
mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \
\"I've something important to say!\" Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep \
your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing \
down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. It \
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you \
think you're changed, do you?\" \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I \
can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten \
minutes together!\" \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar. \
\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one \
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_ \
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a \
wretched height to be.\" \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the \
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three \
inches high). In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom \
and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side \
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \
\"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to herself. \
\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; \
and in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking \
thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the \
two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they \
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \"And now which is \
which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to \
try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her \
chin--it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very \
sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to \
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot \
that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and \
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.... \"Come, my head's free \
at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an \
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of \
green leaves that lay far below her. \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And \
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" She was delighted to find \
that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She \
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to \
dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a \
large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its \
wings. \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon. \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice \
indignantly. \"Let me alone!\" \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've \
tried banks, and I've tried hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those \
serpents! There's no pleasing them!\" Alice was more and more puzzled. \"As \
if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I \
must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken \
the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a \
shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they \
must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I'm _not_ \
a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a little girl,\" she \
added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone \
through that day. \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" \
said the Pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl \
or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but \
I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want \
_yours_--I don't like them raw.\" \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in \
a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down \
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled \
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. \
After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her \
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at \
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had \
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since \
she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at \
first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that \
to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open \
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\
\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size; why, I \
should frighten them out of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the \
house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. VI--PIG AND \
PEPPER For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a \
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she \
would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his \
knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and \
large eyes like a frog. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his \
arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn \
tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The \
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An \
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and \
their curls got entangled together. When Alice next peeped out, the \
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, \
staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door and \
knocked. \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that \
for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; \
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly \
hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on \
within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great \
crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \"How am I to get \
in?\" asked Alice. \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's \
the first question, you know.\" Alice opened the door and went in. The door \
led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the \
other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing \
a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which \
seemed to be full of soup. \"There's certainly too much pepper in that \
soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. Even the \
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and \
howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the \
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was \
grinning from ear to ear. \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why your cat grins like that?\" \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the \
Duchess, \"and that's why.\" \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always \
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice. \"You \
don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\" Just then the \
cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing \
everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came \
first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess \
took no notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so \
much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or \
not. \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and \
down in an agony of terror. \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" \
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go \
and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the \
room. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped \
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I \
don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill \
it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She said the \
last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply. \"If you're going \
to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more to do \
with you. Mind now!\" Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, \
what am I to do with this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted \
again so violently that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This \
time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than \
a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it \
trot away quietly into the wood. Alice was a little startled by seeing the \
Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only \
grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \
\"would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here?\" \"In _that_ \
direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a Hatter; and \
in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit \
either you like; they're both mad.\" \"But I don't want to go among mad \
people,\" Alice remarked. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're \
all mad here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\" \"I should like it \
very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\" \"You'll see me \
there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. Alice had not gone much farther before \
she came in sight of the house of the March Hare; it was so large a house \
that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the \
left-hand bit of mushroom. VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY There was a table set out \
under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were \
having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep. The table \
was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. \
\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \"There's \
_plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large \
arm-chair at one end of the table. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on \
hearing this, but all he said was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" \
\"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she \
added aloud. \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to \
it?\" said the March Hare. \"Exactly so,\" said Alice. \"Then you should say \
what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \
\"at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.\" \
\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be \
talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I \
sleep when I breathe!'\" \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the \
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its \
head impatiently and said, without opening its eyes, \"Of course, of course; \
just what I was going to remark myself.\" \"Have you guessed the riddle \
yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \"No, I give it up,\" Alice \
replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the \
Hatter. \"Nor I,\" said the March Hare. Alice gave a weary sigh. \"I think \
you might do something better with the time,\" she said, \"than wasting it in \
asking riddles that have no answers.\" \"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare \
said to Alice, very earnestly. \"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an \
offended tone, \"so I can't take more.\" \"You mean you can't take _less_,\" \
said the Hatter; \"it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\" At this, \
Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither \
of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once \
or twice; the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse \
into the tea-pot. \"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice, \
as she picked her way through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever \
was at in all my life!\" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the \
trees had a door leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \
\"I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went. Once more she found \
herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. Taking the \
little golden key, she unlocked the door that led into the garden. Then she \
set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her \
pocket) till she was about a foot high; then she walked down the little \
passage; and _then_--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among \
the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET \
GROUND A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses \
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily \
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she \
stood watching them. \"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little \
timidly, \"why you are painting those roses?\" Five and Seven said nothing, \
but looked at Two. Two began, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, \
Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one \
in by mistake; and, if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our \
heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she \
comes, to--\" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the \
garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners \
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many \
footsteps and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten \
soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the \
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came \
the royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next \
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the \
White Rabbit. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on \
a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING \
AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all \
stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She \
said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \"My name \
is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added \
to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\" \"Can you play \
croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for Alice. \
\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly. \"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen. \"It's--it's \
a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by the White \
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \"Very,\" said Alice. \
\"Where's the Duchess?\" \"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under \
sentence of execution.\" \"What for?\" said Alice. \"She boxed the Queen's \
ears--\" the Rabbit began. \"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a \
voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling \
up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and \
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious \
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls \
were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to \
double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. \
The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all \
the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen \
was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his \
head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a minute. \"They're \
dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder \
is that there's anyone left alive!\" She was looking about for some way of \
escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. \"It's the \
Cheshire-Cat,\" she said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk \
to.\" \"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat. \"I don't think they play at \
all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone; \"and they all \
quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to \
have any rules in particular.\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat \
in a low voice. \"Not at all,\" said Alice. Alice thought she might as well \
go back and see how the game was going on. So she went off in search of her \
hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which \
seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the \
other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other \
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of \
way, to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under \
her arm, that it might not escape again. Just then Alice ran across the \
Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her arm affectionately into \
Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such \
a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard the \
voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my \
dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\" \"The game's going on rather \
better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \
\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, \
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'\" \"Somebody said,\" Alice \
whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own business!\" \"Ah, \
well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp \
little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of _that_ \
is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\" \
To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began \
to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with \
her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm! \"Now, I give you fair \
warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke, \"either \
you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your \
choice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \"Let's go \
on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much \
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. \
All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the \
other players and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" \
By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen \
and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution. \
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice. \
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are \
all pardoned.\" Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the \
distance, and Alice ran along with the others. IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS? The \
King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with \
a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as \
well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in \
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the \
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the \
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of \
tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice thought, \"and \
hand 'round the refreshments!\" The judge, by the way, was the King and he \
wore his crown over his great wig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \
\"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) I \
suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence \
in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the \
parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"The Queen of Hearts, she made some \
tarts, All on a summer day; The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And \
took them quite away!\" \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the \
White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First \
witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one \
hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have \
finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the \
March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the \
Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\" he said. \"Give your \
evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed \
on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept \
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in \
his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread \
and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was \
beginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and \
bread and butter and went down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" \
he began. \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" \
said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next \
witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She \
carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began \
sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" \
said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a \
low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\" \"Well, if I \
must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, \
mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion \
and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \
\"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the \
White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise when he read \
out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"Alice!\" X--ALICE'S \
EVIDENCE \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped \
over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd \
below. \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \
\"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are back \
in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking \
hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to \
Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \
\"Rule forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\" \
\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the \
Queen. \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale \
and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your verdict,\" he said to the \
jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please \
Your Majesty,\" said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This \
paper has just been picked up. It seems to be a letter written by the \
prisoner to--to somebody.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It \
isn't a letter, after all; it's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" \
said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they can't prove that I did; there's \
no name signed at the end.\" \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else \
you'd have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a \
general clapping of hands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the \
White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit \
read out the verses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've \
heard yet,\" said the King. \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in \
it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that \
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the \
jury consider their verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence \
first--verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The \
idea of having the sentence first!\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, \
turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen \
shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \"Who cares for _you_?\" said \
Alice (she had grown to her full size by this time). \"You're nothing but a \
pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying \
down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, \
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her \
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves \
that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice \
dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've had!\" \"Oh, I've \
had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her sister, as well as \
she could remember them, all these strange adventures of hers that you have \
just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as \
well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.", "CreationDate" ->

the morning were the first day. 1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in \
the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 1:7 \
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the \
firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 1:8 \
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the \
second day. 1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered \
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 1:10 And \
God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters \
called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 1:11 And God said, Let the \
earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding \
fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. \
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his \
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: \
and God saw that it was good. 1:13 And the evening and the morning were the \
third day. 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the \
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for \
seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in the \
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 1:16 And \
God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser \
light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 1:17 And God set them in the \
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over \
the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and \
God saw that it was good. 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the \
fourth day. 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the \
moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the \
open firmament of heaven. 1:21 And God created great whales, and every living \
creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their \
kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the \
waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 1:23 And the evening \
and the morning were the fifth day. 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring \
forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and \
beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 1:25 And God made the beast \
of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing \
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \
1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let \
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, \
and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing \
that creepeth upon the earth. 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in \
the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 1:28 And \
God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and \
replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the \
sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth \
upon the earth. 1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb \
bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the \
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 1:30 \
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every \
thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every \
green herb for meat: and it was so. 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had \
made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the \
sixth day. 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host \
of them. 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and \
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 2:3 And God \
blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested \
from all his work which God created and made. 2:4 These are the generations \
of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the \
LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field \
before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for \
the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a \
man to till the ground. 2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and \
watered the whole face of the ground. 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the \
dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and \
man became a living soul. 2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in \
Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 2:9 And out of the ground \
made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good \
for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of \
knowledge of good and evil. 2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the \
garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 2:11 The \
name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of \
Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there \
is bdellium and the onyx stone. 2:13 And the name of the second river is \
Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 2:14 And \
the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the \
east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 2:15 And the LORD God \
took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. \
2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden \
thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and \
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou \
shalt surely die. 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man \
should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 2:19 And out of the \
ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the \
air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and \
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 2:20 \
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every \
beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. \
2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: \
and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 \
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and \
brought her unto the man. 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, \
and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out \
of Man. 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall \
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 2:25 And they were both \
naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 3:1 Now the serpent was \
more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he \
said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of \
the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit \
of the trees of the garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the \
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye \
touch it, lest ye die. 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not \
surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your \
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 3:6 And \
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant \
to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit \
thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did \
eat. 3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were \
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 3:8 \
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of \
the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD \
God amongst the trees of the garden. 3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, \
and said unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the \
garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 3:11 And he \
said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, \
whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, \
The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did \
eat. 3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast \
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 3:14 And \
the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art \
cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly \
shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 3:15 And I \
will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her \
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 3:16 Unto the \
woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in \
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy \
husband, and he shall rule over thee. 3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because \
thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, \
of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the \
ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \
3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt \
eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat \
bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for \
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 3:20 And Adam called his \
wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 3:21 Unto Adam \
also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. \
3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know \
good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree \
of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him \
forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. \
3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden \
Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the \
tree of life. 4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare \
Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 4:2 And she again bare his \
brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the \
ground. 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the \
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4:4 And Abel, he also brought \
of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had \
respect unto Abel and to his offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering \
he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 4:6 \
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance \
fallen? 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest \
not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou \
shalt rule over him. 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came \
to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his \
brother, and slew him. 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy \
brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 4:10 And he said, \
What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the \
ground. 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her \
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou tillest \
the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive \
and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, \
My punishment is greater than I can bear. 4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me \
out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; \
and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to \
pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. 4:15 And the LORD said \
unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him \
sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should \
kill him. 4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in \
the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she \
conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the \
city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: \
and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat \
Lamech. 4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was \
Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the \
father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 4:21 And his \
brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp \
and organ. 4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every \
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 4:23 And \
Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of \
Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a \
young man to my hurt. 4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech \
seventy and sevenfold. 4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, \
and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed \
instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born \
a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of \
the LORD. 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that \
God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female \
created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day \
when they were created. 5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and \
begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name \
Seth: 5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred \
years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived \
were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 5:6 And Seth lived an \
hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat \
Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all \
the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 5:9 And \
Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived after he begat \
Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11 \
And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 5:12 \
And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And Cainan lived \
after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and \
daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: \
and he died. 5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: \
5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty \
years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were \
eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 5:18 And Jared lived an \
hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after \
he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And \
all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. \
5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22 And \
Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and \
begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred \
sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God \
took him. 5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and \
begat Lamech. 5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred \
eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of \
Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 5:28 And \
Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 5:29 And he \
called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work \
and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 5:30 \
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and \
begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred \
seventy and seven years: and he died. 5:32 And Noah was five hundred years \
old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 6:1 And it came to pass, when men \
began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto \
them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; \
and they took them wives of all which they chose. 6:3 And the LORD said, My \
spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his \
days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 6:4 There were giants in the earth \
in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the \
daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men \
which were of old, men of renown. 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man \
was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his \
heart was only evil continually. 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had \
made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 6:7 And the LORD \
said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both \
man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it \
repenteth me that I have made them. 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of \
the LORD. 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and \
perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 6:10 And Noah begat \
three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before \
God, and the earth was filled with violence. 6:12 And God looked upon the \
earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon \
the earth. 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before \
me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will \
destroy them with the earth. 6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms \
shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. \
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the \
ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the \
height of it thirty cubits. 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in \
a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in \
the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. \
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to \
destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and \
every thing that is in the earth shall die. 6:18 But with thee will I \
establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, \
and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 6:19 And of every living thing \
of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them \
alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 6:20 Of fowls after their \
kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth \
after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. \
6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather \
it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 6:22 Thus did \
Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. 7:1 And the LORD \
said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I \
seen righteous before me in this generation. 7:2 Of every clean beast thou \
shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are \
not clean by two, the male and his female. 7:3 Of fowls also of the air by \
sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the \
earth. 7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth \
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will \
I destroy from off the face of the earth. 7:5 And Noah did according unto all \
that the LORD commanded him. 7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the \
flood of waters was upon the earth. 7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and \
his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters \
of the flood. 7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of \
fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two \
and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded \
Noah. 7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood \
were upon the earth. 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the \
second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the \
fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. \
7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 7:13 In the \
selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, \
and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; \
7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their \
kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, \
and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 7:15 And they went \
in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of \
life. 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as \
God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 7:17 And the flood was forty \
days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it \
was lift up above the earth. 7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were \
increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the \
waters. 7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the \
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 7:20 Fifteen \
cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 7:21 \
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, \
and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and \
every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was \
in the dry land, died. 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which \
was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping \
things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: \
and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 7:24 \
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 8:1 And \
God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with \
him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters \
asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were \
stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned \
from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty \
days the waters were abated. 8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on \
the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 8:5 And the \
waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on \
the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 8:6 And it \
came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark \
which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and \
fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8:8 Also he sent \
forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of \
the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she \
returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole \
earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him \
into the ark. 8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent \
forth the dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the \
evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew \
that the waters were abated from off the earth. 8:12 And he stayed yet other \
seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any \
more. 8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the \
first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off \
the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, \
the face of the ground was dry. 8:14 And in the second month, on the seven \
and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 8:15 And God spake unto \
Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and \
thy sons' wives with thee. 8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that \
is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every \
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly \
in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 8:18 And Noah \
went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 8:19 \
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth \
upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 8:20 And Noah \
builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every \
clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 8:21 And the LORD \
smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again \
curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart \
is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing \
living, as I have done. 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, \
and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. \
9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and \
multiply, and replenish the earth. 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of \
you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, \
upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into \
your hand are they delivered. 9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be \
meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 9:4 But \
flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. \
9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every \
beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's \
brother will I require the life of man. 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by \
man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 9:7 And \
you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and \
multiply therein. 9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, \
saying, 9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your \
seed after you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the \
fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that \
go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 9:11 And I will establish my \
covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters \
of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. \
9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me \
and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual \
generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token \
of a covenant between me and the earth. 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when \
I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 \
And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living \
creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy \
all flesh. 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, \
that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living \
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 9:17 And God said unto Noah, \
This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and \
all flesh that is upon the earth. 9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth \
of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. \
9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth \
overspread. 9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a \
vineyard: 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was \
uncovered within his tent. 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the \
nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 9:23 And Shem and \
Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went \
backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were \
backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 9:24 And Noah awoke from \
his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 9:25 And he said, \
Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 9:26 \
And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his \
servant. 9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of \
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 9:28 And Noah lived after the flood \
three hundred and fifty years. 9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine \
hundred and fifty years: and he died. 10:1 Now these are the generations of \
the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after \
the flood. 10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, \
and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and \
Riphath, and Togarmah. 10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, \
Kittim, and Dodanim. 10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in \
their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their \
nations. 10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. \
10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and \
Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 10:8 And Cush begat \
Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 10:9 He was a mighty hunter \
before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter \
before the LORD. 10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, \
and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 10:11 Out of that land went \
forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 \
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 10:13 And \
Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 10:14 And \
Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 10:15 \
And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the Jebusite, and \
the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the \
Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and \
afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 10:19 And the \
border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; \
as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto \
Lasha. 10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their \
tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 10:21 Unto Shem also, the \
father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to \
him were children born. 10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and \
Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and \
Gether, and Mash. 10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 10:25 \
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days \
was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 10:26 And Joktan \
begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, \
and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And \
Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 10:30 And \
their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. \
10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, \
in their lands, after their nations. 10:32 These are the families of the sons \
of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the \
nations divided in the earth after the flood. 11:1 And the whole earth was of \
one language, and of one speech. 11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed \
from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt \
there. 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn \
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. \
11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may \
reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad \
upon the face of the whole earth. 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city \
and the tower, which the children of men builded. 11:6 And the LORD said, \
Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they \
begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have \
imagined to do. 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their \
language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 11:8 So the LORD \
scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they \
left off to build the city. 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; \
because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from \
thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 11:10 \
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat \
Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem lived after he begat \
Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 11:12 And Arphaxad \
lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13 And Arphaxad lived after \
he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. \
11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah lived \
after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and \
daughters. 11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 \
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat \
sons and daughters. 11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 \
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons \
and daughters. 11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: \
11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and \
begat sons and daughters. 11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat \
Nahor: 11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and \
begat sons and daughters. 11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and \
begat Terah: 11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and \
nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 11:26 And Terah lived seventy \
years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 11:27 Now these are the generations \
of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 11:28 And \
Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the \
Chaldees. 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife \
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the \
father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 11:30 But Sarai was barren; she \
had no child. 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran \
his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they \
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; \
and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 11:32 And the days of Terah were \
two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. 12:1 Now the LORD had \
said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from \
thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: 12:2 And I will make \
of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and \
thou shalt be a blessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and \
curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be \
blessed. 12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot \
went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out \
of Haran. 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and \
all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had \
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into \
the land of Canaan they came. 12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the \
place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the \
land. 12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I \
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared \
unto him. 12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of \
Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: \
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the \
LORD. 12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 12:10 And \
there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn \
there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 12:11 And it came to pass, \
when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, \
Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore \
it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall \
say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. \
12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for \
thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 12:14 And it came to pass, \
that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she \
was very fair. 12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her \
before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 12:16 And he \
entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, \
and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 12:17 And the \
LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai \
Abram's wife. 12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou \
hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? 12:19 \
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: \
now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 12:20 And Pharaoh \
commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and \
all that he had. 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and \
all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 13:2 And Abram was very \
rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 13:3 And he went on his journeys from \
the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the \
beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he \
had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. \
13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. \
13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: \
for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 13:7 \
And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen \
of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the \
land. 13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, \
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be \
brethren. 13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray \
thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; \
or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. 13:10 And \
Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well \
watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as \
the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. \
13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and \
they separated themselves the one from the other. 13:12 Abram dwelled in the \
land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his \
tent toward Sodom. 13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before \
the LORD exceedingly. 13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was \
separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where \
thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all \
the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. \
13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can \
number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. 13:17 \
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; \
for I will give it unto thee. 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and \
dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar \
unto the LORD. 14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of \
Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of \
nations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha \
king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the \
king of Bela, which is Zoar. 14:3 All these were joined together in the vale \
of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, \
and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 14:5 And in the fourteenth year \
came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims \
in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh \
Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is \
by the wilderness. 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is \
Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, \
that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and \
the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the \
king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale \
of Siddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of \
nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings \
with five. 14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings \
of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to \
the mountain. 14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and \
all their victuals, and went their way. 14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's \
brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. 14:13 And \
there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in \
the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and \
these were confederate with Abram. 14:14 And when Abram heard that his \
brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own \
house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. 14:15 And he \
divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, \
and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 14:16 And \
he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and \
his goods, and the women also, and the people. 14:17 And the king of Sodom \
went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and \
of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's \
dale. 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and \
he was the priest of the most high God. 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, \
Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 \
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy \
hand. And he gave him tithes of all. 14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto \
Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. 14:22 And Abram \
said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most \
high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, 14:23 That I will not take from \
a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is \
thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that \
which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with \
me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. 15:1 After these \
things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, \
Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. 15:2 And Abram said, \
LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of \
my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou \
hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 15:4 And, \
behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine \
heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine \
heir. 15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, \
and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So \
shall thy seed be. 15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him \
for righteousness. 15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee \
out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 15:8 And he \
said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 15:9 And he \
said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three \
years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young \
pigeon. 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, \
and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 15:11 \
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 15:12 \
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an \
horror of great darkness fell upon him. 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of \
a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and \
shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And \
also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall \
they come out with great substance. 15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in \
peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 15:16 But in the fourth \
generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is \
not yet full. 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it \
was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between \
those pieces. 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, \
saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto \
the great river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, \
and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the \
Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, \
and the Jebusites. 16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she \
had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 16:2 And Sarai said unto \
Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go \
in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram \
hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her \
maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and \
gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, \
and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was \
despised in her eyes. 16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: \
I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, \
I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. 16:6 But \
Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it \
pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. \
16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the \
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 16:8 And he said, Hagar, \
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I \
flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 16:9 And the angel of the LORD said \
unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 16:10 \
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed \
exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. 16:11 And the angel \
of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, \
and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. \
16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and \
every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his \
brethren. 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou \
God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? \
16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between \
Kadesh and Bered. 16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his \
son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six \
years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. 17:1 And when Abram was ninety \
years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the \
Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 17:2 And I will make my \
covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 17:3 And \
Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4 As for me, \
behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. \
17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be \
Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. 17:6 And I will make \
thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall \
come out of thee. 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee \
and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to \
be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 17:8 And I will give unto \
thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all \
the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. \
17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, \
and thy seed after thee in their generations. 17:10 This is my covenant, \
which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man \
child among you shall be circumcised. 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh \
of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. \
17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man \
child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money \
of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. 17:13 He that is born in thy \
house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and \
my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 17:14 And the \
uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that \
soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 17:15 And \
God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name \
Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. 17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee \
a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of \
nations; kings of people shall be of her. 17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his \
face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that \
is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? \
17:18 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 17:19 \
And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt \
call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an \
everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. 17:20 And as for Ishmael, \
I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, \
and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will \
make him a great nation. 17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, \
which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 17:22 And \
he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 17:23 And Abraham \
took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were \
bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and \
circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said \
unto him. 17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was \
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 17:25 And Ishmael his son was \
thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. \
17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 17:27 \
And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the \
stranger, were circumcised with him. 18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in \
the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 \
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when \
he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward \
the ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, \
pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little water, I pray \
you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 18:5 \
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye \
shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So \
do, as thou hast said. 18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, \
and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make \
cakes upon the hearth. 18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf \
tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. \
18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set \
it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 18:9 \
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the \
tent. 18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the \
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in \
the tent door, which was behind him. 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and \
well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of \
women. 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed \
old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 18:13 And the LORD said \
unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a \
child, which am old? 18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time \
appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah \
shall have a son. 18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was \
afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 18:16 And the men rose up \
from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring \
them on the way. 18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that \
thing which I do; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and \
mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \
18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household \
after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and \
judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of \
him. 18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, \
and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down now, and see \
whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come \
unto me; and if not, I will know. 18:22 And the men turned their faces from \
thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 18:23 \
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with \
the wicked? 18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt \
thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are \
therein? 18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the \
righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, \
that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 18:26 \
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I \
will spare all the place for their sakes. 18:27 And Abraham answered and \
said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but \
dust and ashes: 18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty \
righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I \
find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. 18:29 And he spake unto him \
yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he \
said, I will not do it for forty's sake. 18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let \
not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be \
found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 18:31 And \
he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: \
Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not \
destroy it for twenty's sake. 18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be \
angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found \
there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. 18:33 And the LORD \
went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham \
returned unto his place. 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and \
Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and \
he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold \
now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all \
night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. \
And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 19:3 And he \
pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his \
house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did \
eat. 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of \
Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from \
every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are \
the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may \
know them. 19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door \
after him, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 19:8 \
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray \
you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only \
unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my \
roof. 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow \
came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with \
thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came \
near to break the door. 19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled \
Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 19:11 And they smote the \
men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: \
so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 19:12 And the men said unto \
Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, \
and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For \
we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the \
face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 19:14 And Lot went \
out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, \
Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he \
seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 19:15 And when the morning \
arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy \
two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the \
city. 19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon \
the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being \
merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. \
19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he \
said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the \
plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 19:18 And Lot said unto \
them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in \
thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me \
in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take \
me, and I die: 19:20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a \
little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul \
shall live. 19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning \
this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast \
spoken. 19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou \
be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 19:23 The \
sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 19:24 Then the LORD \
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of \
heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the \
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 19:26 But his \
wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 19:27 And \
Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the \
LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land \
of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the \
smoke of a furnace. 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities \
of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of \
the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 19:30 And \
Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters \
with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his \
two daughters. 19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is \
old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner \
of all the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will \
lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 19:33 And they made \
their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with \
her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 19:34 \
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, \
Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this \
night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of \
our father. 19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and \
the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, \
nor when she arose. 19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by \
their father. 19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: \
the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 19:38 And the younger, \
she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of \
the children of Ammon unto this day. 20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence \
toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned \
in Gerar. 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and \
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 20:3 But God came to Abimelech \
in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for \
the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 20:4 But Abimelech \
had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous \
nation? 20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself \
said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my \
hands have I done this. 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know \
that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee \
from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 20:7 Now \
therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray \
for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that \
thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. 20:8 Therefore Abimelech \
rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these \
things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 20:9 Then Abimelech \
called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have \
I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? \
thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 20:10 And Abimelech \
said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 20:11 \
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this \
place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 20:12 And yet indeed she is \
my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my \
mother; and she became my wife. 20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me \
to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness \
which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of \
me, He is my brother. 20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and \
menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him \
Sarah his wife. 20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: \
dwell where it pleaseth thee. 20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have \
given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a \
covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus \
she was reproved. 20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, \
and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 20:18 For the \
LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of \
Sarah Abraham's wife. 21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the \
LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare \
Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. \
21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom \
Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being \
eight days old, as God had commanded him. 21:5 And Abraham was an hundred \
years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 21:6 And Sarah said, God \
hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. 21:7 And she \
said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children \
suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 21:8 And the child grew, and \
was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was \
weaned. 21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born \
unto Abraham, mocking. 21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this \
bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with \
my son, even with Isaac. 21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's \
sight because of his son. 21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be \
grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in \
all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac \
shall thy seed be called. 21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I \
make a nation, because he is thy seed. 21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the \
morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, \
putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she \
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 21:15 And the water \
was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. \
21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it \
were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she \
sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 21:17 And God heard \
the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and \
said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the \
voice of the lad where he is. 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in \
thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 21:19 And God opened her \
eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with \
water, and gave the lad drink. 21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, \
and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 21:21 And he dwelt in the \
wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. \
21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief \
captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that \
thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not \
deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according \
to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the \
land wherein thou hast sojourned. 21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear. 21:25 \
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's \
servants had violently taken away. 21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who \
hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, \
but to day. 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto \
Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe \
lambs of the flock by themselves. 21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What \
mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 21:30 And he \
said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be \
a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 21:31 Wherefore he called \
that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 21:32 Thus they \
made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief \
captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. \
21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name \
of the LORD, the everlasting God. 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the \
Philistines' land many days. 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, \
that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, \
here I am. 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom \
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a \
burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 22:3 And \
Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of \
his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt \
offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. \
22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar \
off. 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; \
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 22:6 And \
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; \
and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them \
together. 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: \
and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: \
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? 22:8 And Abraham said, My son, \
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of \
them together. 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and \
Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his \
son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 22:10 And Abraham stretched \
forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 22:11 And the angel of \
the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he \
said, Here am I. 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither \
do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou \
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. 22:13 And Abraham lifted \
up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by \
his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt \
offering in the stead of his son. 22:14 And Abraham called the name of that \
place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it \
shall be seen. 22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of \
heaven the second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the \
LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, \
thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying \
I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is \
upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 22:18 \
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou \
hast obeyed my voice. 22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they \
rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. 22:20 \
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, \
Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 22:21 Huz \
his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And \
Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 22:23 And Bethuel \
begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 22:24 \
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and \
Thahash, and Maachah. 23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty \
years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 23:2 And Sarah died in \
Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to \
mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 23:3 And Abraham stood up from before \
his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a \
sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I \
may bury my dead out of my sight. 23:5 And the children of Heth answered \
Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince \
among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall \
withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 23:7 \
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to \
the children of Heth. 23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your \
mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me \
to Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, \
which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is \
worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. \
23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite \
answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that \
went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the \
field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the \
presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 23:12 And \
Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 23:13 And he spake \
unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou \
wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; \
take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 23:14 And Ephron answered \
Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth \
four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury \
therefore thy dead. 23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham \
weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons \
of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. \
23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, \
the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the \
field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 23:18 Unto \
Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all \
that went in at the gate of his city. 23:19 And after this, Abraham buried \
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same \
is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 23:20 And the field, and the cave that is \
therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by \
the sons of Heth. 24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the \
LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. 24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest \
servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy \
hand under my thigh: 24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of \
heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son \
of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt \
go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. \
24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be \
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto \
the land from whence thou camest? 24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou \
that thou bring not my son thither again. 24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which \
took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which \
spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this \
land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my \
son from thence. 24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, \
then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither \
again. 24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his \
master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 24:10 And the servant took \
ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of \
his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the \
city of Nahor. 24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by \
a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out \
to draw water. 24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray \
thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. \
24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men \
of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to pass, that the \
damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may \
drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let \
the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby \
shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 24:15 And it came \
to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was \
born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with \
her pitcher upon her shoulder. 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look \
upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, \
and filled her pitcher, and came up. 24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, \
and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 24:18 And \
she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her \
hand, and gave him drink. 24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she \
said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. \
24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again \
unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 24:21 And the man \
wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey \
prosperous or not. 24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done \
drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two \
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose \
daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house \
for us to lodge in? 24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel \
the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 24:25 She said moreover unto \
him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 24:26 And \
the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 24:27 And he said, \
Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my \
master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the \
house of my master's brethren. 24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her \
mother's house these things. 24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name \
was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 24:30 And it came \
to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and \
when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man \
unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at \
the well. 24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore \
standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the \
camels. 24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, \
and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and \
the men's feet that were with him. 24:33 And there was set meat before him to \
eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, \
Speak on. 24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 24:35 And the LORD hath \
blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him \
flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, \
and camels, and asses. 24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my \
master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 24:37 \
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of \
the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 24:38 But thou shalt \
go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. \
24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. \
24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel \
with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my \
kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thou be clear from this \
my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou \
shalt be clear from my oath. 24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and \
said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I \
go: 24:43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, \
that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I \
pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say to me, \
Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the \
woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. 24:45 And before \
I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her \
pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and \
I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 24:46 And she made haste, and let \
down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy \
camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 24:47 And \
I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of \
Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon \
her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 24:48 And I bowed down my head, \
and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which \
had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his \
son. 24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: \
and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 24:50 \
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: \
we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, \
take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath \
spoken. 24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their \
words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 24:53 And the \
servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and \
gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious \
things. 24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, \
and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me \
away unto my master. 24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the \
damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. \
24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my \
way; send me away that I may go to my master. 24:57 And they said, We will \
call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 24:58 And they called Rebekah, and \
said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 24:59 And \
they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, \
and his men. 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our \
sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess \
the gate of those which hate them. 24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, \
and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took \
Rebekah, and went his way. 24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well \
Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 24:63 And Isaac went out to \
meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, \
and, behold, the camels were coming. 24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, \
and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 24:65 For she had said \
unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And \
the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered \
herself. 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 24:67 \
And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she \
became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's \
death. 25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 25:2 \
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and \
Shuah. 25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were \
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and \
Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of \
Keturah. 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 25:6 But unto the \
sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them \
away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. \
25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an \
hundred threescore and fifteen years. 25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, \
and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered \
to his people. 25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of \
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is \
before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: \
there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 25:11 And it came to pass after \
the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the \
well Lahairoi. 25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, \
whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And these \
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their \
generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and \
Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, \
Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are \
their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according \
to their nations. 25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an \
hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and \
was gathered unto his people. 25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, \
that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the \
presence of all his brethren. 25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, \
Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when \
he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the \
sister to Laban the Syrian. 25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, \
because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his \
wife conceived. 25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she \
said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 25:23 \
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of \
people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be \
stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 25:24 \
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in \
her womb. 25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; \
and they called his name Esau. 25:26 And after that came his brother out, and \
his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac \
was threescore years old when she bare them. 25:27 And the boys grew: and \
Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, \
dwelling in tents. 25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his \
venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came \
from the field, and he was faint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I \
pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name \
called Edom. 25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 25:32 And \
Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this \
birthright do to me? 25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware \
unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau \
bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and \
went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 26:1 And there was a famine \
in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And \
Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 26:2 And the \
LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land \
which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with \
thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all \
these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy \
father; 26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and \
will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the \
nations of the earth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, \
and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 26:6 And Isaac \
dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he \
said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, \
the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look \
upon. 26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that \
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, \
behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 26:9 And Abimelech called \
Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, \
She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for \
her. 26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of \
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have \
brought guiltiness upon us. 26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, \
saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. \
26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an \
hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 26:13 And the man waxed great, and \
went forward, and grew until he became very great: 26:14 For he had \
possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: \
and the Philistines envied him. 26:15 For all the wells which his father's \
servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had \
stopped them, and filled them with earth. 26:16 And Abimelech said unto \
Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 26:17 And Isaac \
departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt \
there. 26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged \
in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after \
the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his \
father had called them. 26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and \
found there a well of springing water. 26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did \
strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the \
name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 26:21 And they digged \
another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. \
26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they \
strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the \
LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 26:23 And \
he went up from thence to Beersheba. 26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the \
same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am \
with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant \
Abraham's sake. 26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name \
of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a \
well. 26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his \
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 26:27 And Isaac said unto \
them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from \
you? 26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and \
we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and \
let us make a covenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we \
have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and \
have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 26:30 And \
he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 26:31 And they rose up \
betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, \
and they departed from him in peace. 26:32 And it came to pass the same day, \
that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had \
digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 26:33 And he called it \
Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 26:34 And \
Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri \
the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 26:35 Which were \
a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 27:1 And it came to pass, that \
when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he \
called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, \
Behold, here am I. 27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day \
of my death: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver \
and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4 And make \
me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my \
soul may bless thee before I die. 27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to \
Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring \
it. 27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy \
father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and make \
me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my \
death. 27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I \
command thee. 27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good \
kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as \
he loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and \
that he may bless thee before his death. 27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his \
mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 \
My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; \
and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 27:13 And his mother \
said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch \
me them. 27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and \
his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 27:15 And Rebekah \
took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, \
and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 27:16 And she put the skins of the \
kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And \
she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the \
hand of her son Jacob. 27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My \
father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 27:19 And Jacob said \
unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou \
badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may \
bless me. 27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found \
it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to \
me. 27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel \
thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 27:22 And Jacob went \
near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's \
voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 27:23 And he discerned him not, \
because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. \
27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 27:25 And he \
said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul \
may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought \
him wine and he drank. 27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near \
now, and kiss me, my son. 27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he \
smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell \
of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 \
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, \
and plenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow \
down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down \
to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that \
blesseth thee. 27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of \
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac \
his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 27:31 And he also \
had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his \
father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may \
bless me. 27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he \
said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 27:33 And Isaac trembled very \
exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought \
it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, \
and he shall be blessed. 27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, \
he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, \
Bless me, even me also, O my father. 27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with \
subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 27:36 And he said, Is not he \
rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away \
my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, \
Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 27:37 And Isaac answered and said \
unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I \
given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and \
what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 27:38 And Esau said unto his father, \
Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. \
And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 27:39 And Isaac his father answered \
and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, \
and of the dew of heaven from above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, \
and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have \
the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 27:41 And \
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: \
and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; \
then will I slay my brother Jacob. 27:42 And these words of Esau her elder \
son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and \
said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort \
himself, purposing to kill thee. 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; \
arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few \
days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger \
turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I \
will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you \
both in one day? 27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life \
because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of \
Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall \
my life do me? 28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, \
and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. \
28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and \
take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. \
28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, \
that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee the blessing of \
Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the \
land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 28:5 And Isaac \
sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the \
Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 28:6 When Esau saw \
that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a \
wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, \
Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob \
obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau \
seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then \
went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the \
daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. \
28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 28:11 And he \
lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun \
was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his \
pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 28:12 And he dreamed, and \
behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and \
behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 28:13 And, behold, \
the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, \
and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, \
and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and \
thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and \
to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth \
be blessed. 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all \
places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I \
will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. \
28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in \
this place; and I knew it not. 28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How \
dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is \
the gate of heaven. 28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took \
the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and \
poured oil upon the top of it. 28:19 And he called the name of that place \
Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 28:20 And \
Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this \
way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 28:21 So \
that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my \
God: 28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's \
house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto \
thee. 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the \
people of the east. 29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, \
lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they \
watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 29:3 And \
thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the \
well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's \
mouth in his place. 29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? \
And they said, Of Haran are we. 29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the \
son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 29:6 And he said unto them, Is he \
well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with \
the sheep. 29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that \
the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed \
them. 29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered \
together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water \
the sheep. 29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her \
father's sheep; for she kept them. 29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw \
Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his \
mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's \
mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 29:11 And Jacob \
kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel \
that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran \
and told her father. 29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings \
of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and \
kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. \
29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he \
abode with him the space of a month. 29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because \
thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, \
what shall thy wages be? 29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the \
elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 29:17 Leah was tender \
eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 29:18 And Jacob loved \
Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger \
daughter. 29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than \
that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 29:20 And Jacob served \
seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love \
he had to her. 29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days \
are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 29:22 And Laban gathered together \
all the men of the place, and made a feast. 29:23 And it came to pass in the \
evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went \
in unto her. 29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for \
an handmaid. 29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was \
Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I \
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 29:26 And \
Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before \
the firstborn. 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the \
service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 29:28 And Jacob \
did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife \
also. 29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be \
her maid. 29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel \
more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 29:31 And when the \
LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. \
29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for \
she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my \
husband will love me. 29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and \
said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me \
this son also: and she called his name Simeon. 29:34 And she conceived again, \
and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, \
because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 29:35 \
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the \
LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. 30:1 And when \
Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and \
said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 30:2 And Jacob's anger was \
kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld \
from thee the fruit of the womb? 30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go \
in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children \
by her. 30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in \
unto her. 30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 30:6 And Rachel \
said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a \
son: therefore called she his name Dan. 30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid \
conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 30:8 And Rachel said, With \
great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and \
she called his name Naphtali. 30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, \
she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 30:10 And Zilpah Leah's \
maid bare Jacob a son. 30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called \
his name Gad. 30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 30:13 And \
Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called \
his name Asher. 30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found \
mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel \
said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 30:15 And she \
said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and \
wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore \
he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 30:16 And Jacob came \
out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, \
Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's \
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, \
and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 30:18 And Leah said, God \
hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she \
called his name Issachar. 30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the \
sixth son. 30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now \
will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she \
called his name Zebulun. 30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called \
her name Dinah. 30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, \
and opened her womb. 30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God \
hath taken away my reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, \
The LORD shall add to me another son. 30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel \
had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto \
mine own place, and to my country. 30:26 Give me my wives and my children, \
for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which \
I have done thee. 30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found \
favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD \
hath blessed me for thy sake. 30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I \
will give it. 30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served \
thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 30:30 For it was little which thou \
hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD \
hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own \
house also? 30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou \
shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again \
feed and keep thy flock. 30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, \
removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown \
cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of \
such shall be my hire. 30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time \
to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is \
not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that \
shall be counted stolen with me. 30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it \
might be according to thy word. 30:35 And he removed that day the he goats \
that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled \
and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among \
the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 30:36 And he set three \
days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's \
flocks. 30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and \
chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear \
which was in the rods. 30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before \
the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to \
drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 30:39 And the \
flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, \
speckled, and spotted. 30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the \
faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of \
Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's \
cattle. 30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did \
conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the \
gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 30:42 But when the cattle \
were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the \
stronger Jacob's. 30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much \
cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. 31:1 And he \
heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was \
our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this \
glory. 31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was \
not toward him as before. 31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the \
land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 31:4 And \
Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 31:5 And \
said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as \
before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 31:6 And ye know that \
with all my power I have served your father. 31:7 And your father hath \
deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt \
me. 31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the \
cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; \
then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 31:9 Thus God hath taken away the \
cattle of your father, and given them to me. 31:10 And it came to pass at the \
time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a \
dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, \
speckled, and grisled. 31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, \
saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine \
eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, \
speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 31:13 \
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou \
vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return \
unto the land of thy kindred. 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said \
unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's \
house? 31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and \
hath quite devoured also our money. 31:16 For all the riches which God hath \
taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever \
God hath said unto thee, do. 31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and \
his wives upon camels; 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his \
goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in \
Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 31:19 And \
Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her \
father's. 31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he \
told him not that he fled. 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose \
up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. \
31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 31:23 And \
he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and \
they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian \
in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to \
Jacob either good or bad. 31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had \
pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the \
mount of Gilead. 31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that \
thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as \
captives taken with the sword? 31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, \
and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee \
away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 31:28 And hast \
not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done \
foolishly in so doing. 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: \
but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed \
that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 31:30 And now, though thou \
wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, \
yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 31:31 And Jacob answered and said to \
Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by \
force thy daughters from me. 31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let \
him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and \
take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 31:33 And \
Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two \
maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, \
and entered into Rachel's tent. 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and \
put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all \
the tent, but found them not. 31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not \
displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women \
is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. 31:36 And Jacob was \
wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my \
trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 31:37 \
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy \
household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they \
may judge betwixt us both. 31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy \
ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock \
have I not eaten. 31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto \
thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen \
by day, or stolen by night. 31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed \
me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 31:41 Thus \
have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy \
two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages \
ten times. 31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the \
fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. \
God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee \
yesternight. 31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters \
are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my \
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto \
these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 31:44 Now \
therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a \
witness between me and thee. 31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for \
a pillar. 31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they \
took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 31:47 \
And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 31:48 And \
Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore \
was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD \
watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 31:50 If thou \
shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my \
daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 31:51 \
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I \
have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be \
witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not \
pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 31:53 The God of \
Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And \
Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 31:54 Then Jacob offered \
sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did \
eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. 31:55 And early in the morning \
Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and \
Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 32:1 And Jacob went on his way, \
and the angels of God met him. 32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is \
God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 32:3 And Jacob \
sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the \
country of Edom. 32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto \
my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and \
stayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and \
menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may \
find grace in thy sight. 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \
We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four \
hundred men with him. 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and \
he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the \
camels, into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and \
smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 32:9 And Jacob \
said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which \
saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal \
well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of \
all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I \
passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 32:11 Deliver me, I \
pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear \
him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 32:12 \
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of \
the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 32:13 And he lodged there \
that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau \
his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred \
ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty \
kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 32:16 And he delivered \
them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto \
his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. \
32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth \
thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and \
whose are these before thee? 32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant \
Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is \
behind us. 32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that \
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye \
find him. 32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. \
For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and \
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 32:21 So \
went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the \
company. 32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two \
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 32:23 \
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. \
32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the \
breaking of the day. 32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, \
he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out \
of joint, as he wrestled with him. 32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day \
breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 32:27 \
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 32:28 And he \
said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince \
hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 32:29 And Jacob \
asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore \
is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 32:30 And \
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, \
and my life is preserved. 32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose \
upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 32:32 Therefore the children of \
Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the \
thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the \
sinew that shrank. 33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, \
behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children \
unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 33:2 And he put the \
handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and \
Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed \
himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 33:4 \
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed \
him: and they wept. 33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the \
children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which \
God hath graciously given thy servant. 33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, \
they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 33:7 And Leah also with \
her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and \
Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all \
this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of \
my lord. 33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast \
unto thyself. 33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found \
grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have \
seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased \
with me. 33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; \
because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he \
urged him, and he took it. 33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and \
let us go, and I will go before thee. 33:13 And he said unto him, My lord \
knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are \
with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. \
33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead \
on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be \
able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 33:15 And Esau said, Let \
me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What \
needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 33:16 So Esau returned \
that day on his way unto Seir. 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and \
built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the \
place is called Succoth. 33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, \
which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his \
tent before the city. 33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had \
spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for \
an hundred pieces of money. 33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called \
it EleloheIsrael. 34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto \
Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 34:2 And when Shechem the \
son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay \
with her, and defiled her. 34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of \
Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 34:4 And \
Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 34:5 \
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were \
with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. \
34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. \
34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the \
men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in \
Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 34:8 \
And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for \
your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 34:9 And make ye marriages \
with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. \
34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and \
trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 34:11 And Shechem said \
unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and \
what ye shall say unto me I will give. 34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and \
gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the \
damsel to wife. 34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his \
father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: \
34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to \
one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 34:15 But in \
this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you \
be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will \
take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one \
people. 34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then \
will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 34:18 And their words pleased \
Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 34:19 And the young man deferred not to do \
the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more \
honourable than all the house of his father. 34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his \
son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their \
city, saying, 34:21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell \
in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for \
them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our \
daughters. 34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with \
us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are \
circumcised. 34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast \
of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with \
us. 34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out \
of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of \
the gate of his city. 34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they \
were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, \
took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the \
males. 34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the \
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 34:27 The sons of \
Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled \
their sister. 34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, \
and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And \
all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they \
captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 34:30 And Jacob said to \
Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the \
inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being \
few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; \
and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 34:31 And they said, Should he deal \
with our sister as with an harlot? 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up \
to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared \
unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 35:2 Then \
Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the \
strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 35:3 \
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto \
God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way \
which I went. 35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were \
in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid \
them under the oak which was by Shechem. 35:5 And they journeyed: and the \
terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did \
not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in \
the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with \
him. 35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because \
there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 35:8 \
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an \
oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 35:9 And God appeared unto \
Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. 35:10 And God \
said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more \
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 35:11 And \
God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and \
a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; \
35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, \
and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 35:13 And God went up from \
him in the place where he talked with him. 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in \
the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a \
drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 35:15 And Jacob called the \
name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 35:16 And they journeyed \
from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel \
travailed, and she had hard labour. 35:17 And it came to pass, when she was \
in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have \
this son also. 35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for \
she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him \
Benjamin. 35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which \
is Bethlehem. 35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar \
of Rachel's grave unto this day. 35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his \
tent beyond the tower of Edar. 35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt \
in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: \
and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of \
Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and \
Issachar, and Zebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 \
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the \
sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, \
which were born to him in Padanaram. 35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his \
father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and \
Isaac sojourned. 35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore \
years. 35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his \
people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. \
36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 36:2 Esau took his \
wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and \
Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And \
Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 36:4 And Adah bare to Esau \
Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and \
Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in \
the land of Canaan. 36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his \
daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his \
beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and \
went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 36:7 For their \
riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein \
they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 36:8 Thus \
dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 36:9 And these are the generations of \
Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of \
Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of \
Bashemath the wife of Esau. 36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, \
Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's \
son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. \
36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and \
Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 36:14 And these were \
the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's \
wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. 36:15 These were \
dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; \
duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, \
and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of \
Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel \
Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the \
dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath \
Esau's wife. 36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke \
Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah \
the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is \
Edom, and these are their dukes. 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, \
who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 36:21 And \
Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the \
children of Seir in the land of Edom. 36:22 And the children of Lotan were \
Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 36:23 And the children of \
Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 36:24 And \
these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah \
that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his \
father. 36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the \
daughter of Anah. 36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and \
Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, \
and Zaavan, and Akan. 36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. \
36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, \
duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are \
the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 36:31 And \
these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned \
any king over the children of Israel. 36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned \
in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 36:33 And Bela died, and \
Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 36:34 And Jobab died, \
and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 36:35 And Husham died, \
and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in \
his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 36:36 And Hadad died, and \
Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of \
Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 36:38 And Saul died, and \
Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 36:39 And Baalhanan the son \
of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was \
Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter \
of Mezahab. 36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, \
according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, \
duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 36:42 \
Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be \
the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their \
possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites. 37:1 And Jacob dwelt in \
the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 37:2 These \
are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding \
the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and \
with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his \
father their evil report. 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his \
children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of \
many colours. 37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more \
than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto \
him. 37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they \
hated him yet the more. 37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this \
dream which I have dreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the \
field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your \
sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 37:8 And his \
brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed \
have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and \
for his words. 37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his \
brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun \
and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 37:10 And he told it \
to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto \
him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and \
thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 37:11 \
And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 37:12 And \
his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 37:13 And Israel \
said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I \
will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 37:14 And he said to \
him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with \
the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of \
Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 37:15 And a certain man found him, and, \
behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What \
seekest thou? 37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, \
where they feed their flocks. 37:17 And the man said, They are departed \
hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his \
brethren, and found them in Dothan. 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, \
even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. \
37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 37:20 Come \
now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will \
say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of \
his dreams. 37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their \
hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed \
no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no \
hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to \
his father again. 37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his \
brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours \
that was on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the \
pit was empty, there was no water in it. 37:25 And they sat down to eat \
bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of \
Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and \
myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 37:26 And Judah said unto his \
brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? \
37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be \
upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. \
37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted \
up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty \
pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 37:29 And Reuben \
returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent \
his clothes. 37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is \
not; and I, whither shall I go? 37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed \
a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And they sent the \
coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This \
have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 37:33 And he knew \
it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is \
without doubt rent in pieces. 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put \
sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 37:35 And all \
his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be \
comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son \
mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 37:36 And the Midianites sold him \
into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. \
38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his \
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 38:2 \
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; \
and he took her, and went in unto her. 38:3 And she conceived, and bare a \
son; and he called his name Er. 38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; \
and she called his name Onan. 38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a \
son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. \
38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 38:7 \
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD \
slew him. 38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and \
marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 38:9 And Onan knew that the seed \
should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's \
wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his \
brother. 38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he \
slew him also. 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a \
widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest \
peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in \
her father's house. 38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah \
Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his \
sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 38:13 And \
it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to \
shear his sheep. 38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and \
covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which \
is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not \
given unto him to wife. 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an \
harlot; because she had covered her face. 38:16 And he turned unto her by the \
way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not \
that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that \
thou mayest come in unto me? 38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from \
the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 38:18 \
And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy \
bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came \
in unto her, and she conceived by him. 38:19 And she arose, and went away, \
and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. \
38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to \
receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 38:21 Then he \
asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by \
the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 38:22 And he \
returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place \
said, that there was no harlot in this place. 38:23 And Judah said, Let her \
take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not \
found her. 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was \
told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and \
also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, \
and let her be burnt. 38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her \
father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she \
said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and \
staff. 38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more \
righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew \
her again no more. 38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, \
that, behold, twins were in her womb. 38:28 And it came to pass, when she \
travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon \
his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 38:29 And it came to \
pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she \
said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his \
name was called Pharez. 38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had \
the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 39:1 And \
Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, \
captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the \
Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 39:2 And the LORD was with \
Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master \
the Egyptian. 39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that \
the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 39:4 And Joseph found \
grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his \
house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 39:5 And it came to pass \
from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that \
he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the \
blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. \
39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he \
had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and \
well favoured. 39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's \
wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 39:8 But he \
refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what \
is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; \
39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back \
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this \
great wickedness, and sin against God? 39:10 And it came to pass, as she \
spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or \
to be with her. 39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went \
into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house \
there within. 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: \
and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 39:13 And it \
came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was \
fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto \
them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came \
in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came \
to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his \
garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 39:16 And she laid up his garment \
by her, until his lord came home. 39:17 And she spake unto him according to \
these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, \
came in unto me to mock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my \
voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 39:19 And it \
came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake \
unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was \
kindled. 39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a \
place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. \
39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour \
in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 39:22 And the keeper of the prison \
committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and \
whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 39:23 The keeper of the \
prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was \
with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 40:1 And it \
came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his \
baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth \
against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against \
the chief of the bakers. 40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the \
captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 40:4 \
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: \
and they continued a season in ward. 40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of \
them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the \
interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, \
which were bound in the prison. 40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the \
morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 40:7 And he asked \
Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, \
saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 40:8 And they said unto him, We \
have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto \
them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. 40:9 \
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, \
behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and \
it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters \
thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: \
and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the \
cup into Pharaoh's hand. 40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the \
interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within \
three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: \
and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner \
when thou wast his butler. 40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with \
thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto \
Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away \
out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they \
should put me into the dungeon. 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the \
interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, \
behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost \
basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did \
eat them out of the basket upon my head. 40:18 And Joseph answered and said, \
This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 \
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall \
hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. 40:20 \
And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made \
a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler \
and of the chief baker among his servants. 40:21 And he restored the chief \
butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: \
40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 40:23 \
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 41:1 And it \
came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, \
he stood by the river. 41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven \
well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 41:3 And, \
behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured \
and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. \
41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well \
favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 41:5 And he slept and dreamed the \
second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and \
good. 41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung \
up after them. 41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full \
ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 41:8 And it came to \
pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for \
all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told \
them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. \
41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my \
faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in \
ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 41:11 \
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according \
to the interpretation of his dream. 41:12 And there was there with us a young \
man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he \
interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did \
interpret. 41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me \
he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and \
called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved \
himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 41:15 And Pharaoh \
said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can \
interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a \
dream to interpret it. 41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not \
in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 41:17 And Pharaoh said unto \
Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 41:18 And, \
behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well \
favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came \
up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never \
saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill \
favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had \
eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were \
still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 41:22 And I saw in my \
dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 41:23 \
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, \
sprung up after them: 41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: \
and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it \
to me. 41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God \
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 41:26 The seven good kine are \
seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 41:27 \
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven \
years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven \
years of famine. 41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: \
What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 41:29 Behold, there come \
seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 41:30 And there \
shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be \
forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 \
And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine \
following; for it shall be very grievous. 41:32 And for that the dream was \
doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, \
and God will shortly bring it to pass. 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look \
out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 41:34 Let \
Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the \
fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 41:35 And let \
them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under \
the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 41:36 And that \
food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which \
shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. \
41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all \
his servants. 41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a \
one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 41:39 And Pharaoh said \
unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so \
discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and \
according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will \
I be greater than thou. 41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set \
thee over all the land of Egypt. 41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his \
hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine \
linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in \
the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and \
he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 41:44 And Pharaoh said unto \
Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot \
in all the land of Egypt. 41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name \
Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah \
priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 41:46 And \
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And \
Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the \
land of Egypt. 41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth \
by handfuls. 41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which \
were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of \
the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 41:49 \
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left \
numbering; for it was without number. 41:50 And unto Joseph were born two \
sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of \
Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 41:51 And Joseph called the name of \
the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, \
and all my father's house. 41:52 And the name of the second called he \
Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. \
41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, \
were ended. 41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as \
Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of \
Egypt there was bread. 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the \
people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, \
Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 41:56 And the famine was over all \
the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto \
the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 41:57 And all \
countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine \
was so sore in all lands. 42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in \
Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 42:2 And he \
said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, \
and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 42:3 And Joseph's \
ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's \
brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure \
mischief befall him. 42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those \
that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 42:6 And Joseph was the \
governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the \
land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with \
their faces to the earth. 42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, \
but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said \
unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy \
food. 42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 42:9 And \
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye \
are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 42:10 And they said \
unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 42:11 We are \
all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 42:12 And he \
said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 42:13 \
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the \
land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and \
one is not. 42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto \
you, saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of \
Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come \
hither. 42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall \
be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth \
in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 42:17 And he put \
them all together into ward three days. 42:18 And Joseph said unto them the \
third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let \
one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn \
for the famine of your houses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; \
so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 42:21 \
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in \
that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not \
hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 42:22 And Reuben answered \
them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and \
ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 42:23 And \
they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an \
interpreter. 42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and \
returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, \
and bound him before their eyes. 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their \
sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give \
them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 42:26 And they laded \
their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 42:27 And as one of them \
opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; \
for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 42:28 And he said unto his brethren, \
My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed \
them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath \
done unto us? 42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of \
Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is \
the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the \
country. 42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 \
We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is \
this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 42:33 And the man, the lord \
of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave \
one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your \
households, and be gone: 42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then \
shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I \
deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 42:35 And it \
came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of \
money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of \
money, they were afraid. 42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have \
ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will \
take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 42:37 And Reuben spake \
unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: \
deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 42:38 And he \
said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is \
left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall \
ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 43:1 And the famine was \
sore in the land. 43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn \
which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, \
buy us a little food. 43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did \
solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your \
brother be with you. 43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go \
down and buy thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go \
down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother \
be with you. 43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to \
tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 43:7 And they said, The man asked \
us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet \
alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of \
these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother \
down? 43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and \
we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and \
also our little ones. 43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou \
require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let \
me bear the blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we \
had returned this second time. 43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, \
If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your \
vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, \
spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your \
hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry \
it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take also your \
brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God Almighty give you \
mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. \
If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. 43:15 And the men took that \
present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, \
and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 43:16 And when Joseph saw \
Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, \
and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. 43:17 And \
the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. \
43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; \
and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the \
first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall \
upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 43:19 And they came near to \
the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the \
house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy \
food: 43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our \
sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money \
in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 43:22 And other \
money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put \
our money in our sacks. 43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your \
God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had \
your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 43:24 And the man brought \
the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; \
and he gave their asses provender. 43:25 And they made ready the present \
against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. \
43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in \
their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 43:27 \
And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old \
man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 43:28 And they answered, Thy servant \
our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their \
heads, and made obeisance. 43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his \
brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, \
of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. \
43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and \
he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. \
43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, \
Set on bread. 43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by \
themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: \
because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an \
abomination unto the Egyptians. 43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn \
according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the \
men marvelled one at another. 43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them \
from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of \
their's. And they drank, and were merry with him. 44:1 And he commanded the \
steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they \
can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 44:2 And put my \
cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. \
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 44:3 As soon as the \
morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 44:4 And \
when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto \
his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say \
unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 44:5 Is not this it in \
which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in \
so doing. 44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. \
44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid \
that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8 Behold, the money, \
which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the \
land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or \
gold? 44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and \
we also will be my lord's bondmen. 44:10 And he said, Now also let it be \
according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and \
ye shall be blameless. 44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack \
to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 44:12 And he searched, and \
began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in \
Benjamin's sack. 44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his \
ass, and returned to the city. 44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to \
Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. \
44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye \
not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 44:16 And Judah said, What \
shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear \
ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my \
lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 44:17 And \
he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is \
found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your \
father. 44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy \
servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger \
burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 44:19 My lord asked \
his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 44:20 And we said unto \
my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little \
one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his \
father loveth him. 44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down \
unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 44:22 And we said unto my lord, \
The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his \
father would die. 44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your \
youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 44:24 And \
it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the \
words of my lord. 44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little \
food. 44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with \
us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our \
youngest brother be with us. 44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye \
know that my wife bare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I \
said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye \
take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray \
hairs with sorrow to the grave. 44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy \
servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound \
up in the lad's life; 44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad \
is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray \
hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 44:32 For thy \
servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not \
unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 44:33 Now \
therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to \
my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 44:34 For how shall I go up \
to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil \
that shall come on my father. 45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself \
before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out \
from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known \
unto his brethren. 45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of \
Pharaoh heard. 45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my \
father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were \
troubled at his presence. 45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near \
to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, \
whom ye sold into Egypt. 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with \
yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to \
preserve life. 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and \
yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor \
harvest. 45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the \
earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 45:8 So now it was not \
you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, \
and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 45:9 \
Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son \
Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: \
45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto \
me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and \
thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11 And there will I nourish thee; for \
yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all \
that thou hast, come to poverty. 45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the \
eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. \
45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that \
ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 45:14 And \
he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon \
his neck. 45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and \
after that his brethren talked with him. 45:16 And the fame thereof was heard \
in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased \
Pharaoh well, and his servants. 45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto \
thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of \
Canaan; 45:18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and \
I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of \
the land. 45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of \
the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your \
father, and come. 45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the \
land of Egypt is your's. 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph \
gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them \
provision for the way. 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of \
raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five \
changes of raiment. 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten \
asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn \
and bread and meat for his father by the way. 45:24 So he sent his brethren \
away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by \
the way. 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of \
Canaan unto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet \
alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart \
fainted, for he believed them not. 45:27 And they told him all the words of \
Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph \
had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And \
Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him \
before I die. 46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came \
to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 46:2 \
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, \
Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy \
father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great \
nation: 46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely \
bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 46:5 And \
Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their \
father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh \
had sent to carry him. 46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, \
which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and \
all his seed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his \
daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into \
Egypt. 46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came \
into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 46:9 And the sons \
of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 46:10 And the sons of \
Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son \
of a Canaanitish woman. 46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and \
Merari. 46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, \
and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez \
were Hezron and Hamul. 46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and \
Job, and Shimron. 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and \
Jahleel. 46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in \
Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his \
daughters were thirty and three. 46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and \
Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 46:17 And the sons of \
Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and \
the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, \
whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even \
sixteen souls. 46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. \
46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, \
which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 46:21 \
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and \
Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 46:22 These are the sons \
of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 46:23 And \
the sons of Dan; Hushim. 46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, \
and Jezer, and Shillem. 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave \
unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were \
seven. 46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of \
his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and \
six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two \
souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were \
threescore and ten. 46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct \
his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 46:29 And Joseph \
made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and \
presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a \
good while. 46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have \
seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. 46:31 And Joseph said unto his \
brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and \
say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of \
Canaan, are come unto me; 46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade \
hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their \
herds, and all that they have. 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh \
shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 46:34 That ye shall \
say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until \
now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; \
for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 47:1 Then Joseph \
came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, \
and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; \
and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 47:2 And he took some of his \
brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 47:3 And Pharaoh \
said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, \
Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 47:4 They said \
morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy \
servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land \
of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of \
Goshen. 47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy \
brethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the \
best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen \
let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make \
them rulers over my cattle. 47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and \
set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto \
Jacob, How old art thou? 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the \
years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the \
days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the \
years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 47:10 And \
Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 47:11 And Joseph \
placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of \
Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had \
commanded. 47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all \
his father's household, with bread, according to their families. 47:13 And \
there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the \
land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. \
47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of \
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph \
brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 47:15 And when money failed in the \
land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, \
and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money \
faileth. 47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for \
your cattle, if money fail. 47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: \
and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and \
for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread \
for all their cattle for that year. 47:18 When that year was ended, they came \
unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my \
lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; \
there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our \
lands: 47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? \
buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto \
Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be \
not desolate. 47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for \
the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over \
them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 47:21 And as for the people, he removed \
them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end \
thereof. 47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests \
had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which \
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 47:23 Then Joseph \
said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for \
Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 47:24 And it \
shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto \
Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for \
your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little \
ones. 47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in \
the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 47:26 And Joseph \
made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have \
the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not \
Pharaoh's. 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of \
Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied \
exceedingly. 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so \
the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. 47:29 And the \
time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said \
unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand \
under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, \
in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out \
of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou \
hast said. 47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And \
Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. 48:1 And it came to pass after \
these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took \
with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 48:2 And one told Jacob, and \
said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened \
himself, and sat upon the bed. 48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty \
appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said \
unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will \
make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after \
thee for an everlasting possession. 48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and \
Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto \
thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 48:6 And \
thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be \
called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 48:7 And as for \
me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the \
way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried \
her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. 48:8 And Israel \
beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 48:9 And Joseph said unto his \
father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, \
Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 48:10 Now the eyes \
of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them \
near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 48:11 And Israel said \
unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me \
also thy seed. 48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and \
he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 48:13 And Joseph took them both, \
Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left \
hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 48:14 And \
Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was \
the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands \
wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and \
said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which \
fed me all my life long unto this day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from \
all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of \
my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst \
of the earth. 48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand \
upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's \
hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 48:18 And Joseph \
said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy \
right hand upon his head. 48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, \
my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: \
but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall \
become a multitude of nations. 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In \
thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: \
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, \
Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land \
of your fathers. 48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy \
brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with \
my bow. 49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves \
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. \
49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto \
Israel your father. 49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the \
beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of \
power: 49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up \
to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 49:5 \
Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their \
habitations. 49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their \
assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a \
man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. 49:7 Cursed be their \
anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide \
them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy \
brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy \
father's children shall bow down before thee. 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: \
from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a \
lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? 49:10 The sceptre shall not \
depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; \
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 49:11 Binding his foal \
unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his \
garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes \
shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 49:13 Zebulun shall \
dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his \
border shall be unto Zidon. 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down \
between two burdens: 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that \
it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto \
tribute. 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. \
49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth \
the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 49:18 I have waited \
for thy salvation, O LORD. 49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he \
shall overcome at the last. 49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he \
shall yield royal dainties. 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth \
goodly words. 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a \
well; whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely grieved \
him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and \
the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of \
Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 49:25 Even by the \
God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless \
thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, \
blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father \
have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of \
the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown \
of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 49:27 Benjamin shall \
ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he \
shall divide the spoil. 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and \
this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one \
according to his blessing he blessed them. 49:29 And he charged them, and \
said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers \
in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave \
that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of \
Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a \
possession of a buryingplace. 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his \
wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. \
49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the \
children of Heth. 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his \
sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was \
gathered unto his people. 50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and \
wept upon him, and kissed him. 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the \
physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 50:3 And \
forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those \
which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten \
days. 50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the \
house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I \
pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made me swear, \
saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of \
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, \
and bury my father, and I will come again. 50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and \
bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 50:7 And Joseph went up to \
bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders \
of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house \
of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, \
and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 50:9 And \
there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great \
company. 50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond \
Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he \
made a mourning for his father seven days. 50:11 And when the inhabitants of \
the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, \
This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was \
called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 50:12 And his sons did unto him \
according as he commanded them: 50:13 For his sons carried him into the land \
of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which \
Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron \
the Hittite, before Mamre. 50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his \
brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had \
buried his father. 50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was \
dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite \
us all the evil which we did unto him. 50:16 And they sent a messenger unto \
Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall \
ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, \
and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive \
the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when \
they spake unto him. 50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before \
his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 50:19 And Joseph said \
unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 50:20 But as for you, ye \
thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it \
is this day, to save much people alive. 50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I \
will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake \
kindly unto them. 50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's \
house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 50:23 And Joseph saw \
Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the \
son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 50:24 And Joseph said \
unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of \
this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. \
50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will \
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 50:26 So Joseph \
died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was \
put in a coffin in Egypt.", "CreationDate" ->
